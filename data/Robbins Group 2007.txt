The group's photo section has been revised with some new albums &  approximately 50 or more new photos added. Yahoo has increased our file  space for the site so there's lots of room. If anyone else has any  photos they want to share with the group, please let me know.  For those interested in the Civil War, two new photos have been added  to Janet Kinney's album that are quite interesting. One is of Joseph  Broadwater (husband of Sarah Robbins Broadwater) in his later years &  the colt revolver inscribed with his name that he carried in the Civil  War.   Thank you Debby Muench & Kurt Weidner for your recent contributions to  the Photo Section. Sara

In his depredations he scarcely  recognized friend or foe. He resided near Long Neck (now New  Springerville) The house which he occupied was demolished many years  ago. It stood near the corner of the roads leading to Richmond & Port  Richmond fronting the former. Robbins was an Englishman by birth, extremely dissolute in his  habits, & a terror not only to those who dwelt in his neighborhood  but of the whole Island. His wife a native of Staten Island, & a  daughter of widow Mary Merrill. His depredations were generally  committed under some disguise, which he supposed effectually  concealed his identity though he was often betrayed by his voice or  some other tell-tale circumstances.   Robbins' death was hailed with a great deal of relief by the people  of Staten Island, for there was a constant fear that life & property  were in danger. It is said that his grave was several times marked by  stones bearing inscriptions relative to the life he lived; but within  a few days after each stone was erected it disappeared mysteriously  under the cover of darkness.

Sara,  Thanks very much for the information. I think due to this man's despicable existence, I sure hope we can determine that he was an Englishman, and not one of our Scottish line. Although I fear that if the widow Merril has connections to Jonathan as we have already determined much earlier, by the land sale to Jonathan, I don't see how she would otherwise know of Jonathan other than by direct relationship such as her marriage to Nathaniel and therefore was Jonathan a blood relative of Nathaniel.  Brian

Sara,
I haven't found a will transcription yet but did stumble across a couple of interesting sites with much Merrill data - and interestingly enough - links to Hopewell and then Rowan Co., NC. No Robins or Robbins found but many similar names like Benjamin, William, Richard etc...

As the story says, Nathaniel was from England.  Most of the Robbins on Long Island and NY were from the English Robbins and NOT from the Robinsons from Scotland and therefore not related to our Jersey Robins/Robbins.  John

Tamara,
 
Excellent links for the Merrill family history. Thank you. One site says two Merrill families left NJ for NC in 1751. This was the same time Anne Merrill sold her land to Jonathan Robins. So far I can't locate a Will for a widow Merrill in NJ or Staten Island as referenced in the Morris book. The book gives no date for the Will & that makes it a little more difficult. Also it's very likely Nathaniel & Mary Merrill Robbins had children which leaves a possiblity for living descendants. 
 
What was the 1755 Jersey Settlement in NC? Were there Robins there?

I enjoyed reading about the Jersey Settlement from the Google reference, Judy.  I now live in California, but I was born in Burlington, New Jersey.  I am related to the Robbins on my father's side.  His mother was Carrie Robbins Eldridge.  However, my mother was adopted as a baby, and the family who adopted her was named Smith, a common name in early Burlington, as well as everywhere else.  I recognized some of the last names of the early settlers as the same last names of people I went to school with in Burlington.  Also, mention is made of the ship Shield  that moored at Burlington in the 1600's.  I remember a bronze plaque on a large rock in Burlington commenorating the event.  It is on the Delaware River in front of the VFW home there on Union Street.

The Jersey Settlement web site is just great.  It explains why there was such a huge migration from Hunterdon County to Rowan County, NC.  It was called Cox's Rebellion as I recall.  Just put Jersey Settlement into Google.  I don't recall any Robins/Robbins going there, however.  I think some went to Kentucky.  I could be wrong about that, but I am usually looking out for such things.  You will find many Hunterdon County names in the history of that incident. Judy Arthur

Judy,
 
Thanks. I agree the Jersey Settlement site is great & Ethel Stroupe's article on the origins of the settlement in NC is very well written. It certainly sheds light for me on one of the reasons NJ families migrated. It's amazing how resilient these families were in dealing with the difficulties of losing their land.

The widow Merrill of Staten Island died Nov 30, 1789 & from looking  at a copy of her will her first name was Mary & she had a daughter  Mary w/o Nathaniel Robins. This rules out that she was the widow Anne  Merrill of Hunterdon Co.   Early Staten Island records contain family names that also appear in  NJ counties. A few that stand out with proven & unproven links to the  NJ Robins/Robbins family are Nathaniel Britton, Hunterdon Co., Jacob  Garrites/Garrison, Salem/Cumberland Co., Obadiah Holmes, Monmouth  Co., Merrill, Hunterdon Co, Abraham & Peter Prall, Hunterdon Co.  Travel by the colonists wasn't unusual or limited, some migrated &  settled, others just visited.   Another interesting note from Staten Island history is that it almost  became part of NJ. The question arose after the Duke of York conveyed  the territory of NJ to Carteret & Berkley as to whether Staten Island  was included. Possibly this was due to the close proximity of Staten  Island to the shore of NJ. Carteret didn't lay claim to Staten Island  & in 1668 it was agreed that it would go to NY.   Sara

[Robbinsfamilysouthjersey] Sex In Middlesex: Popular Mores in a Massachusetts Co., 1649-1699
From:
turkeypt2 <july37@cox.net>
View Contact
To:
Robbinsfamilysouthjersey@yahoogroups.com 


The story of William Potter, Hope's father & Rebecca Potter her  sister were recorded in the Ct court. There is a good probability our  family had others whose stories didn't become public.  Eastman's Online Genealogy Newsletter The DAILY newsletter for genealogy consumers.  September 04, 2007 Sex in Middlesex: A Book Review Centuries ago, our ancestors were all staunch, conservative people,  the pillars of society. Right? Everyone attended church and rigidly  followed the dictates of religious and community leaders. Puritans  exhibited "tolerance, mutual regard, affection, and prudent common  sense." It is only in recent years that morals have decayed, crime  has increased, and promiscuous sex has become commonplace. Correct?  Yeah, right.  A book by Roger Thompson published about twenty years ago refutes  those stereotypes. In the book Sex in Middlesex: Popular Mores in a  Massachusetts County, 1649-1699, Thompson reveals that our ancestors  carried on in a more freewheeling style than do most folks today.  Thompson closely studied the court cases of Middlesex County,  Massachusetts, for the years 1649 through 1699. He summarizes his  findings in this book and also names many of the people prosecuted.  This is a resource you might not want to overlook when researching  Middlesex County ancestors!  In those years the Puritan Church was the leading religion in  Middlesex County. However, Thompson points out that a much higher  percentage of the general population was prosecuted for crimes at  that time than today. That is, the "crime rate" was higher in the  1600s than today.   Note: Of course, that statement assumes that the legal authorities  prosecuted crimes with the same vigor then as today. It also assumes  the definition of a crime has not changed since the 1600s. Neither  assumption is correct. Nonetheless, the crime rate obviously was very  high in the 1600s, even by today's standards.  Many of the "crimes" of the 1600s would be ignored today, such as  fines for failure to attend church, uttering oaths in public, working  on the Sabbath, or drawing away the affections of a maid. However,  other crimes of today were quite popular years ago as well: murder,  robbery, rape, swindling, non-performance of contract, disorderly  conduct, and more.  Perhaps the most common "crime" in the 1600s was that of sexual  intercourse. There were different variations of it from a legal  viewpoint, depending on whether or not the lady became pregnant and  also whether or not the couple was willing to get married. The  punishment for the young ladies was often worse than for the the men.  Public whippings on the bare backs of 8-month-pregnant women were not  uncommon. The strictest punishments of all were handed out when  the "couple" were both of the same sex. That seems ironic for a  county named "Middlesex."  Another ironic twist can only be determined after studying modern  biology. Today's fertility experts report that the chances of  conceiving a child are about one in fifty. That is, to conceive a  child, a couple has to commit sex an average of fifty times.  Obviously, as an average, you can expect there are wide variations in  that number, both above and below.  The courts of the 1600s did not possess that bit of information about  fertility. When reading the old court documents, it becomes apparent  that the courts assumed that the ratio was closer to one-to-one. It  is probable that many more couples engaged in sexual activity than  the few who happened to get caught.   When an unmarried woman was convicted of fornication, the court had  the task of determining the father, after which they levied fines and  ordered the man to pay child maintenance as well. We will never know  how accurate the court judgments were in determining fatherhood, but  it is a safe bet that the error rate was high.   Surprisingly, one of the more common crimes of our ancestors was the  act of bestiality. There are many, many cases of this prosecuted in  Middlesex County in the 1600s. The number of convictions for  bestiality seems to be very high for a county that had a rather low  population by today's standards. If you had ancestors in Middlesex  County in those years, you may be surprised when you open this book  and discover what your ancestors were really doing. I bet THOSE  stories were not handed down in the family from generation to  generation!  Sex in Middlesex is a fascinating read. It will appeal to most family  historians who wish to learn more about the times in which our  ancestors lived. We can assume that most North American counties had  somewhat similar stories as those who came from Puritan and  conservative Middlesex County in Massachusetts.  Sex in Middlesex was published in 1989 but is still available through  most bookstores if you specify ISBN 0870236563. I found it listed on  RootsBooks.com, Amazon.com, and BarnesAndNoble. com, and I suspect it  is available elsewhere as well. It is available in both hardcover and  paperback.  A "limited preview" (excerpts) of the book, but not all pages, can be  found on Google Books at http://tinyurl. com/34vdz9.  Posted by Dick Eastman on September 04, 2007 | Permalink

Brian,
 
I was wondering the same thing about the two Merrill widow's Anne & Mary. There may have been some relationship so it's always something to keep in mind.  At least we have proof that they aren't the same women.
 
According to Morris' History of Staten Island the notorious  Rev. War character Nathaniel Robins lived at New Springerville on Staten Island where the Stone Road met Poverty Lane. It was called Robbins' Corner. Morris also writes "Robyn's Rift, a reef in the bay at the mouth of the Kill Van Kull was once frequented by seals, to which the Dutch gave the name Robyn; hence the name became Robyn's Rift which has by careless usage become Robbins' Reef." Was Robyn the name for seals in Dutch? Robyn doesn't seem like a Dutch word to me but then I'm not very well versed in the Dutch language.
 
It was really great to meet Marshall & spend some time with him.

Sara,
Tell me again the reference to the land sale of Anne Merrill in Hunterdon, please. As I recall, it just mentioned her name and transfer of property in Hunterdon Co. It didn't say 'The Widow Anne Merrill of Hunterdon County' did it? She could still be a resident of Staten Island and own land in NJ. In fact I think I read that Nathaniel lived in Staten Island and owned land in NJ. If this is the case, I'm not sure I'd rule her out as the same person.

Tamara,
 
That's a good point, I'm not sure if the original deed referred to Anne Merrill as a widow. I don't have a copy of the original document to check on the wording. John T. or Marshall may have one from their trips to extract Hunterdon Co. deeds. 
Hunterdon County Deed Abstracts. Book 5 Page 152 Date 5/23/1751 Recorded 1808, Grantor Anne Merrill----Grantee Jonathan Robins, Bethlehem Twsp 234 Acres.
Reference found on pages 8 & 249 of the Robins, Robbins of NJ book.
 
Mary Merrill died 11/30/1789 of Richmond Co., Staten Island, a widow & mother of Mary Robins. Reference: Record of Wills Book A, pg. 28-30, St George, NY Surrogate Office, 11/5/1931.
 
A possible relationship between these two woman but no proof. The above records indicate they aren't the same person. We see travel from Staten Island across the river to NJ with familiar family names connected to the Robins family settling in NJ. It seems likely some of the Merrills of Staten Island were among the others.
 
Nathaniel Robins was a witness to the Will of Silas Bedell who died 7/18/1795 in Richmond Co., Staten Island. I guessing this was the infamous Nathaniel Robins. It appears he wasn't despised by everyone. Mr. Bedell ask him to witness his Will & some person kept replacing the gravestones that were continually removed by the person who we assume didn't like him. There could be another side to the story that was written about him as part of Staten Island folk lore.

Thanks to those who have responded to my inquiry on YDNA testing for  the 5-Richard line.  Instead of copying only the 5-Richard people I want to include the  entire group regarding the recent DNA results from our 5-Richard line.  Two men were tested from the line of David Robbins (1788-1852) David  was one of the four sons of John (1755-1823) & Temperance Sheppard  Robbins. 1. John Robbins, III 1780-1855 2. Richard 1783-1851 3. David 1788-1852 4. Levi 1793-1859  The results of the two descendants of the above David Robbins from  two different branches of that line do not match the Daniel Robins  group.  At this time a descendant of David's brother Levi has agreed to test.  It would be very helpful to test the lines of the other two brothers  John Robbins, III & Richard. There are living descendants from both  John 3rd & Richard. The results of the Levi Robbins line when  returned will add an important piece in determining the biological  relationship of the 5-Richard line to Daniel Robins.  The 5-Richard Robbins female lines of Caruthers, Gardiner, Garrison,  Glann, Ladow, Lore, Sharp & others are not eligible for the YDNA  testing. Those of us who do family research realize the importance of  validating our documentation & now we have genetic genealogy to  assist with this process. I encourage those in the 5-Richard line who  are really interested in finding answers to seek out possible  candidates for testing. Of course, all help would be appreciated  should anyone come in contact with a qualified 5-Richard male.  Sara

Sara:
 
I'm a little confused.  You state that the 2 individuals that tested do not match, however my DNA page shows a Brian Robbins linked to you e-mail address does show up as an 11/12 match to my own DNA.  While this type of match OFTEN turns out to be random, that is not the case in our particular DNA sequence.  due to a combination of a pair of rare markers in our sequence, it is probable that an 11/12 match that is linked to the Robbins/Robins surnames is most likely not random and probably is as good as a match.  This was suspected when June Nash's submission of DNA by David Robbins turned out to also have an 11/12 match.  Testing of additional markers did indeed prove that David was related to us.  So when you say two people didn't match, I wonder if Brian is one of them.  If so, then I'd be willing to bet that further testing would prove that he is actually a match that happens to have had 1 marker in the first 13 mutate sometime in the last 300 years of replications.  John German has much more knowledge on the subject than I do, so perhaps he could educate us a little more on the subject.

Gary,
 
I’ll try to explain. I’m not going to give out or post names here out of respect for a person's right to privacy. If the test results were my own then it would be my choice. However, you have access to the Kit #’s & results posted for that specific kit. The two tests I'm referring to in my previous message are as follows:
 
Kit #89492 Tamara has posted on her site. Check results & compare with Family Group # 1.
Kit # 96962 just came back two days ago & matches Kit # 89492. I don’t think there has been time for #96962 to post.
 
John German & Tamara Stevens were consulted when the results of #89492 were received. We agreed that more testing was needed. Hopefully we will be able to locate more participants & convince them to test. Thanks for your input & interest in this area of our family history.

The marker results from our genealogical DNA tests are from the  non-recombing portion of the Y chromosome. Females do not have Y  chromosomes. The inheritance pattern of the Y chromosome is only from  father to son and does not combine with the mother's genetic  contribution. So while a man may have multiple Robbins great grandpas  his Y chromosome will be that which he inherited thru his father's  paternal lineage.

Women don't have a Y chromosome.  Women have 2 X chromosomes.  Woman always give an X.  Men have an X & Y chromosome.   If man gives an X you get a girl.  If he gives a Y you get a boy.  Therefore the Y chromosome is only passed down from father to son.  It is precisely because this chromosome doesn't mix with a female complement, that we are able to trace the males genealogy the way we do.

I am looking for material on Cornelius Robbins who married Anne  Hankinson Robbins in Sussex County in 1811. She is the daughter of  Joseph Hankinson and Margaret Goble. Anne was born in 1791 and died in  Decatur County Iowa. Cornelius was born in Newark, Essex County. I am  interested in finding out the names of their children. I know of  Angeline, William Slater, Jane, and Mary. I have their obituaries. I  know they had 3 sons and 7 daughters and moved to Pickaway County, Ohio  in 1836.

Would anyone know who Obidiah Robbins, b-1697,d-4/20/ 1749 in Cumberland Co, NJ had married and his children? I believe his parents were Richard Robbins and Hannah Moore.  This Obidiah may have named a son Obidiah, who later turned up out 'west' in Rostravier Twp, (then) Bedford Co, Pa. He was a participant in the Rev. War, as a non-combatant. He is listed in the Pa Archives for Westmoreland Co, Pa as a Rev War Militia member. He was instrumental in helping returning captured settlers from Indian captivity during the War. I think he was a Baptist. They were coming from further west in Ohio and Detroit, where they may have been turned over to the British.  This may provide yet another link back to NJ for our Robbins line, and help trace some of the 12 or so Robbins men of in and around that time period who have disappeared from record.  Brian

I have a Cornelius Robins/Robbins that was born in Luzerne County in 1810.  His father was John Robins (born 1785 in NJ) came to Hanover Township, Luzerne County, PA in 1803.  Do you know the father of your Cornelius?  I have not been able to link my grandfather John Robins back to the Daniel Robins line.  The names Mary and William were often used in my family too.  I'm beginning to think I'll never find a link further back than my John Robins.

My database has your Cornelius listed as the son of Cornelius & Sarah, as indicated in the following will abstract:
 
1779, Nov. 21.  Robins, Cornelius, of Knowlton, Sussex Co., farmer; will of.  Wife, Sarah, the profits of the land for her support and the children till my youngest son, Cornelius, is 21.  Son, Andrew, bay horse.  Son, John, bay mare.  Sons, Andrew, John and Cornelius, the lands.  Daughters to have an outset when married.  Executors - Wife, Sarah, and son, Andrew.  Witnesses - Daniel Robins, Bashaba Hunneywell, Henry Crosley.  Proved Sept. 26 1780.

1775, June 29.  Robins, John, of Amwell, Hunterdon Co.; will of.  Wife, Elener Robins, while my widow, the profits of the plantation I live on, and, after her death, to my son John, he paying to my son Cornelius, £50, and to my son Job, £100, when 21; but if Job do not live, then to my daughters, Anna Robins, Mary Robins, Elizabeth Woolverton, Hannah Robins, Jane Kitchen, Rachel Reily, Lydia Parlee, and Catherine Robins.  Witnesses --- James Furman, Israel Chidster, David Chidister.  Proved Sept. 16, 1777.
 
1777, Sept 17.  Inventory, made by Samuel Furman and John Trimmer. Lib. 19, p 444.
I think that said John Robins could have been the son of Daniel Robins Jr and his 2nd wife Mary.  Perhaps other members of the group can help flesh out this information a little.

As you can see the first will that I reference was for a Cornelius Robins of Knowlton, Sussex County. NJ.  In all of my research, I've come across the name Cornelius in 3 lines of the Robins family.
 
1.  Son and numerous grandchildren of Robert Robins and Margaret Sharps.  Margaret's grandfather was Cornelius Vanover
2.  Son and other descendents of John Robins of Hanover Township, Pa.  He was married to Mary Garrison.  She was the daughter of Cornelius Garrison.
3.  Son and other descendents of John Robins & Elener of Sussex County.  I suspect that Cornelius came from Eleners side of the family.
 
I wonder what reference you have that places the birthplace of your Cornelius in Essex County.  I don't have anything to contradict that information, but you can see Johns will was in Hunterdon County and that of Cornelius was in Sussex County.  I can't say for sure that he is, but if John is the son of Daniel Robins Jr., then he was born in Woodbridge.  Daniel Jr lived in Woodbridge, then freehold, then Bucks County, Pennsylvania, (I think) and eventually in Amwell Township, Hunterdon County.  I think some of his children settled in the same area he did.  Also note that the will of John Robins was also in Amwell Township.

Hi Gary,
I got my information about Cornelius being born in Newark, Essex County, from the Family History Center in a town close to me. The three obituaries that I have of the children, all stated they were born in -Essex County in New Jersey. The Family History Center got their information from the Church of Latter Day Saints and from Ancestory.com. Could this be a fourth line? Cornelius and Anne Hankinson Robbins did get married in Sussex County. I have had to "scratch" for every bit of information I have been able to get about Cornelius and Anne. I am so hoping that you have the key to other generations, but what do you think? Thank you so much for your input.   Sandy

The photo of either Cornelius or Elias Robbins in his Union uniform was not identified so I'm not sure who it is.  Both men lived to an advanced age for their time (Elias 76 & Cornelius 85).  The obituaries are from my Luzerne county Robbins family.  Still looking for a definite link to Hope & Daniel Robins.  If there are any new members who have info on my John Robins (1785-1831) who left NJ in 1803 to spend the rest of his life in Luzerne county I'd love to have it!!!

Subject: [SPAM]Re: [Robbinsfamilysouth jersey] 9-Hope Robins/daughter Martha Moore?

FWIW, I have the following note on Martha from Rox Cox at Ancestry World Tree
 
Dispute as to parents. Monette claimed dau of John Moore & Hope Robbins.
There is no evidence that John and Hope (Robbins) Moore had a daughter named Martha. 
Willis Freeman said she was d/o Alexander Moore of New London, Conn. This seems much more likely since she named a son Alexander and in her will she mentioned land she owned in New London or New England.. 
Others claim probably a daughter of Samuel Moore & Experience FitzRandolph.

Your information on Martha was just what I needed to answer the question of Martha Moore's parentage. Willis Freeman's research  is located in the NJ Historical Society's  "Freeman, Worth, Gardner Collection." Thanks for much for your help.

Gary,
 
To my knowledge there is know of no supporting documentation for the 2nd Robert b. to Jonathan & Elizabeth Winters Robins. It is quite possible that The Michael Shoemaker Book made an oversight or a typo on pg. 755 by adding the 2nd Robert. 
 
My thoughts for this is he has Robert Stewart Robins born Aug. 10, 1839, died April 5, 1828. I'm guessing it's a typo. However, the death date is corrected to 1878 down the page when he writes more about Robert Stewart Robins.
 
When Shoemaker lists the names of the children of John S & Sarah Carter Robins he has a  daughter Sarah Spencer for them. This doesn't agree with the 1850 Census for Hanover, Luzerne Co., PA where it  shows John & Sarah's children that includes a son Spencer age 18, & daughter Sarah 14. They are two separate individuals.
 
It was a common practice to use the same name of a deceased child for one born later. So anything is possible but if you don't find Robert with the rest of this family, Shoemaker may be incorrect.

Thank you Sara:
 
I suppose it is also possible that another child named Robert could have been born and died between census recordings and that Shoemaker was aware of the birth and not the death, though in this instance dates are not given.  I think that Shoemaker acknowledges that his information on some of the Robins is partly from Plumb's 1885 "History of Hanover"  He states, as did Plumb that Jonathan Robins removed to Michigan.  I see no evidence of that, as census records place Jonathan in Iowa, though I will concede that with 10 years between census records, it is possible that Jonathan tried to settle in Michigan and then moved on to Iowa.  Plumb also states that Jacob Robins removed from Hanover to Kansas, when actually Jacob removed to Indiana, and then Kansas some years later.  It is perhaps a lesson to all of us that there may be a price to be paid for not doing our own exacting research.

Addressing your comment on Sarah and Spencer Robins.  You are right, I would guess that Shoemaker simply left out the semi colon after Sarah's name.  BTW, though I'm unsure of the relationship of Spencer Carter to Sarah Carter, but I believe that Spencer Carter has some ties to other members of the Robins family.

 Deposition of Isaac Robins 1832  Isaac Robins appeared on Oct. 12, 1832 before the Warren Co. NJ  Court of Common Pleas. He gave his address as Knowlton & age as 74.  He testified that he was born June 29, 1758 in the township of  Amwell, Hunterdon Co., NJ. He said had a record in his possession of  his birth in a book in the handwriting of his father & that he had  lived with his father in the township of Knowlton in the county of  Sussex now Warren ever since the Rev War & when he entered the  service except when he lived in the adjoining township of Hartwick  for four years. He entered the service of the United States as a  private in the Continental army in the fall of 1776. He was first  ordered out for one month & served that time at Elizabethtown under  Capt. John Smith in Col. John Taylor's Regiment, General Maxwell's  Brigade. Next he was ordered in Feb 1777 one month under Capt William  Nyes but was detained six weeks before he was returned serving in the  vicinity of Bound Brook, the British Army then occupying New  Brunswick. He went away every day seven miles to stand on the Piquet  guard and when off duty he was laboring at erecting a fortification  around the Meeting House at that place. In May of 1777, Isaac Robins  went as a substitute for his father & served with Capt. William Nyes  one month at Bound Brook, Daniel Vaughn was his Lieutenant. In the  same year, month not recollected he was ordered out & served one  month at Bound Brook under Capt. Peter Wolf. Afterwards in the same  year month not recollected he served one month under Capt. Abraham  Boschever? in the vicinity of Amboy the British then occupying Amboy  & Staten Island. After his return for the last mentioned tour he  served in the same year 1777 one month under Capt. George Ribble on  the frontier along the Delaware River in the County of Sussex &  immediately afterward in the same year in the same place under the  same captain one month substitute for his father & one month for his  cousin Andrew Robins. At the end of the year 1777, Isaac Robins  enlisted with a team of four horses for the term of ? months under  Capt John Hazelett serving in PA, MD & DE & was discharged at Valley  Forge & immediately enlisted again for one year under Col. Wm Biddle.  The last part of his service was at Poughkeepsie, King's Ferry &  other places he now doesn't recollect in the State of NY. He was  discharged at King's Ferry but immediately Major Johnson kept him in  the service two months longer & he was returned to Middlebrook,  Trenton & once to Boston & back to Trenton by the way of New Windsor.  He was discharged at Trenton early in the year 1780 & in Oct of that  year served as a militia man six weeks along the frontier of the  Delaware River under Capt William Mackeye. Isaac Robins had no  documentation for his service for the court. Judge John Moore of the  Warren Co. Court stated he was acquainted with Isaac Robins & granted  his pension on July 17, 1833. On Aug 9th 1836 Isaac Robins asked for  a transfer of his pension to Columbia Co. PA. He told the PA Court he  had moved from NJ to PA to be with his son.  Notes taken from the deposition of Isaac Robins in his Rev War  Pension file. SRH

Marshall,
 
Isaac Robins refers to his cousin Andrew Robins. Could Andrew be the son Job Robins mentions in his 1756 will?  Who were Isaac's parents? 
 
Isaac Robins' outstanding service to our country at a crucial time in its' history most likely isn't remembered anyplace today except in his pension file. I don't know when he died but I hope he lived on long enough to enjoy his well deserved pension. Maybe he has living descendants out there someplace to claim him as their ancestor.

Marshall,
 
Thanks for your input on this subject of Daniel & Isaac Robins of Hunterdon Co. Could Daniel who died 1802 Sussex Co be the son of 2-Daniels' son John b. 1695 & wife Elener? I see John & Elener's son Cornelius had a son Andrew. Maybe this is Isaac's cousin Andrew? They are listed on pg 22 of the Robins, Robbins of NJ book. Just a theory.
 
A key point given to me by John German was to look at the militia age for NJ to estimate the age of Daniel. The militia age in NJ was 16-50. From the record Isaac was 18 in 1776 when he first went into service & from the militia age requirements his father Daniel was 50 or younger. From this we can estimate Daniel was probably born between 1726-1736. This puts him in the right time frame to be the Daniel who died in 1802 & the son of John Robins b. 1695. He lived in Sussex Co so that's the right location. I would be interesting to find descendants of Daniel & Isaac. We know Isaac's son (name unknown) went to Columbia, PA.

'There is, of course, no good reason why the professional executive should not be successful in many and varied lines. The emphasis in U. S. industry has shifted from production to distribution, and a distribution expert should be able to function with equal facility whether he is distributing Montgomery Ward merchandise or Johns-Manville roofings. Furthermore, he is always working with other executives who have grown up with the company. Thus President Brown has as his Board Chairman William R.

Actually I didn't provide the bio, but had only mentioned where it could be found.  Here is a transcription of that paragraph.  I also located a couple of obituaries and the one from the Chicago Tribune, states where his home is,  which validates the correct 1930 census at ancestry.com. That census names his wife as Lottie, (apparently his 2nd marriage) and children daughter Jean, son Alban F, son  William R. Jr., and daughter Courtney.  Hilda was apparently his 3rd. wife.  I also have a small picture of the headstone of his 1st wife Salome, if anyone is interested.

My Stephen was born in 1768 in New Jersey. Daniel Robins and Stephen  both recieved land grants the same day in Wellandport Lincoln county  Ontario. Their entries were next to one another in the land grant  listing. Seems as if the applications were made at the same time. So,  I can safely assume that they are probably related, but no proof of  brothers. Possibly cousins. I know of a male relation to Daniel, I'd  like to see a DNA test.  As the Daniel Robins (1765) Abigail Vaughnan ? Isaac Robins (1758)  and Stephen(1768) all fall within the same time frame one can't help  but wonder of the relationship. I don't know conclusively Stephen's  father.

Sara, 
Continuing the Isaacs connections, the Fayette Co PA Taxpayers index from T.L.C Genealogy, published 1991 Miami Beach Fla, shows 1785 through 1788 the several Springhill twp Robins. those four years.
Isaac  is earliest, 1785, 1786, next Jacob 1786, 1788. then  William (possibly mine) 1786, John single 1786, 1787,88. One entry for a Richard in that period in Springhill twp.
 
The Springhill twp William Robins b. 1761 and wife Elizabeth Loughead m. Bucks Co 1789. and are resident there through 1783, as indicated by childrens later birth evidence. 
At Bucks Co 1790 were William at New Britain, newly married, no ch.,Isaac at Falls twp at Buckingham.
 
Could they have moved forth and back? Or just paying taxes until the final move west to Fayette?
 
The Springhill twp Warrantee map from "Early Landowners of Penn, Atlas to Twp warrantees shows that a Daniel Robins Warrantee in the Fidelity Tract of 381 acres 2 Jan 1785 was surveyed 1785, and the completed Patent deeded to William Robins 1793, adm. 
 
Since we know that the above William named first son John, second William and third Daniel, and did reside in Springhill until 1815 there may be a connection?

June, If you have opportunity, I would recommend a trip to the Fayette Co, Pa courthouse where the deeds are loaded with Robbins, from this early period you are referring to. These Robbins that are mentioned specifically here in your latest e mail I have looked into. They are from Monmouth Co, NJ. Another group, which settled nearby in Washington County, Pa now called Cecil Twp, has been mentioned by Raymond Bell, and has been posted here on the website and on the Internet also. Cecil Twp Robbins' were there just before the American Revolution and speculation is they are from Hunterdon Co, NJ. Further research, detailed research, of the type involving going to Hunterdon and Monmouth Co's courthouses for what remains of any evidence for these Robbins'would be the solution, if any.  They are almost certainly not of English origin and no evidence ties them to the 'died out' English Va line of Robbins' either. Brian

Gary, Group -
 
The Will of Daniel Robins of the Township of Bethlehem, Hunterdon County, NJ, is dated May 9, 1855.  It was probated before the Hunterdon County Surrogate's Court on June 12, 1855.  Jonathan Robins, a son, was named as sole executor of his estate.  Children named in the will are identified as follows: son, Isaac Robins; son, Daniel I. Robins; daughter, Mary Robins; daughter, Amelia Fisher, wife of William F. Fisher; son, John W. Robins; Emmeline Winters, wife of Lewis C. Winters; and Elizabeth Petty, wife of Charles Petty.
 
From THE HUNTERDON GAZETTE 1845 - 1856 CD, Jonathan Robins, Executor of the estate of Daniel Robins, offered a private sale of 1) a farm containing 140 acres near the village of Bloomsbury in the Township of Bethlehem, and 2) a timber lot containing 20 acres lying near the public road leading from Bloomsbury to Little York.  The article further states "Persons wishing to view the above described property can be shown the same by calling on CHARLES PETTY or ISAAC ROBINS, living on said farm.  Indenture (Vol. 113, p. 557-559 Hunterdon County) April 1, 1856 from Jonathan Robins, executing the last will and testament of Daniel Robins, to Richard Petty conveys 150.47 acres on the south side of the road from the Old Hickory Tavern to Bloomsbury with adjoing land owners mentioned as Charles Petty, James Train, Vliet, Kendy, Smith, Taylor, and Hagunaus.
 
Isaac Robbins (1830 - 1896) is my 2nd great-father.  His Certificate of Death identifies his parents as Daniel and Jane Robins, as well as baptism records.
 
From the Records of the Genealogical Society of New Jersey, transcribed by Bruce D. Sinclair, Daniel Robins and his wife, Jane, d. September 15, 1844, aged 52.8.8 are in the Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Alexandria Township, Hunterdon County.  Daniel's gravestone reads "our father, d. June 2, 1855, aged 68 years, 9 months and 11 days.  I have a photograph of his gravestone.
 
Daniel's age is suspect.  It appears in the 1850 census that his age is either 53 or 58.  In the 1840 census in Bethlehem Township, Daniel Robbins is Head of Household with one male between 40 & 50.  And in 1830, Daniel Robins is in Alexandria Township with one male 15 - 20 and one 40 - 50.
 
Of note, in the 1850 census, Daniel Robbins is Family Number 213 and nearby at 206 is Jonathan Robbins, age 56, and family - Charity, 54, and children: Jonas, Sarah, Sylvester and Elizabeth and James Sedes and Daniel Case. 
 
Hope some of this helps.  With the DNA results, I feel that I now have narrowed my focus on the possible parents of Daniel.

June, 
 
You asked if the Robins in PA moved back & forth. Records show that some did move to the frontier areas & then return to NJ. One example is Timothy Robbins son of Randall & Abigail Rogers Robbins who was unable to pay his debts. He moved to Ohio to avoid imprisonment & returned in his old age to die in NJ. 
Isaac Robins b. 1758 in Hunterdon Co traveled from his pension papers so he had knowledge of places other than his NJ home. Isaac's records show he moved to Columbia Co., PA around 1836 at age 78. The Isaac Robins you name is found in Fayette Co., PA. in 1786. Anything is possible but we don't have enough information to be certain they were the same family. It may be these two men were different Isaac's with a Robins family relationship.

I also have found that the fledgling sometimes returns to the nest.  Take the case of my Robert Robins who was raised in Alexandria Township, Hunterdon Co, NJ.  He married Margaret Sharps of Sussex Co, and around 1800 they moved to Luzerne Co, PA.  Around 1817 he sold his land in PA and bought a Sussex Co farm from his father-in-law.  Then again, sometime after 1830 he moved again, (for the last time) to Luzerne Co, Pa.  Also a grand- daughter of Robert, (Linda Robbins) married a man named Edger Raub Feb 2, 1880  in Wilkes-Barre.  They moved from Pennsylvanian to Colorado where a daughter died in 1882.  their son Earl Raub was born in Leadville, CO. June 26, 1883 and the family had returned to Pennsylvania before Oct 14 1886 birth of their daughter Lena Raub.

Most of the following information comes from Wikipedia.
 
Although, gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper have been mined there, the city was formed about 1877 , after the discovery of several lode silver-lead deposits, which set off the Colorado Silver Boom.  By 1880 Leadville was one of the worlds largest silver camps with a population of over 40,000.  The population was found to be only about 2,821 during the census of 2000.  At an elevation of 10,152 feet above sea level Leadville claims to be the highest city in North America.  The town where I was raised is 7,890 ft above sea level and I can tell you that it takes a good bit of time for new comers to become acclimatized.  No doubt the additional 2250 ft imposed significant hardships for people used to Pennsylvanian elevations
 
Census records show that in 1880 Edward E. Raub was a book keeper in Leadville. In 1900 he lived in Wilkes-Barre, Pa and his job title was LV clerk*, In 1910 he was retired.
 
*Does anyone know what the LV might stand for?

I came across this while researching my Moore family & thought it was  interesting.  THE SMOCK WEDDING  One of the more unusual customs that came to America was the SMOCK  WEDDING. Under English Common Law if a widow remarried and brought  any of her late husband's property to the marriage, the new husband  became liable for any and all the debts of the previous husband.  Women owned nothing in their own right, and this included their  clothing. So it became the custom for indebted widows to get married  in their underwear, or smocks.  The SMOCK WEDDING was triple-fold. It was a bankruptcy proceeding; it  was a marriage ceremony; it was an investiture because the bride then  got a new wardrobe from her new husband.  In theory the ceremony was held for all to see, on a public highway.  But in practice many smock weddings were indoors. When Major Moses JOY married Widow Hannah WARD of Newfame, Vermont,  in 1789, she was stark naked. She was in a closet, her hand extended  through a hole cut in the door. Then she put on a fine set of clothes  and emerged from her closet in style, to the general admiration of  the assembled.  Source: Ancestors and Descendants of LEWIS ROSS FREEMAN with related  families by Freeman Worth Gardner & Willis Freeman Compiled by Patty Barthell Myers, Penobscot Press 1995.

I missed the first part of the 60 Minute segement on DNA. What DNA  testing was used to establish that these two people (Vy & Marion) were  definitely related? Was YDNA from one of Vy's male relatives matched  to Marion's YDNA to determine Marion was Vy's cousin? It's my  understanding that even if one of Vy's male relatives tested & his YDNA  matched with Marion it would not be a 100% guarantee that Vy was also  related to her male relative & to Marion. Only males whose YDNA closely  matches with other males can establish with certainty a relationship to  a common ancestor.

I missed the program, but because the Y DNA doesn't change much, (except for mutations) it is possible that my Y DNA is an exact match with someone that is a descendent of Daniels son Aaron. Since Daniel would be our 9th G-grandfather, then I believe  we would be 10th cousins.  That's a pretty distant relationship.  Then you have to add the fact that if her brothers DNA is tested, the results can't necessarily be considered absolute, unless a different type of DNA testing and analysis is done to ensure that both her and her brother had the same mother and father.

Gary, 
 
I think I understand what you are saying. 
Even though the person you match may be a 10th cousin you still match & this gives you & this other person or persons a certainty that you relate to a common ancestor. However, there is no 100% guarantee for any other male with the same surname who hasn't personally tested to be certain of the same common ancestor as you. All males & females who descend through a female relationship from a common ancestor are unable to do YDNA testing so there is absolutely no guarantee for them that they are actually a descendant of the same common ancestor. I believe this is correct?
 
I was curious if 60 Minutes had done some other type of DNA testing to prove Vy was related to the male used to match with Marion. As you say it would require another type of test & I'm guessing that's in the area of forensic DNA.
 
It appears to me that basing a relationship on just documentation or someone else's YDNA results with or without documentation requires many descendants to assume a relationship that may or may not be accurate.

Sara, I watched the segment. The woman whose ancestry was traced used  a male cousin's DNA. The full transcript of the broadcast can be read  at http://www.cbsnews. com/stories/ 2007/10/05/ 60minutes/ main3334427. shtml  Hope this helps. Wilma Robbins Meaden 9-Aaron

Sara:
 
Yes, but of course we know that the assumption that cousins share the same grandparents is usually true.  There were the occasional instances where a very young child was brought into a 2nd marriage after the death of his father and whether legally adopted or not, this child sometimes ended up with the surname of his new father.  I know that in England, this happened in my mothers own line as late as 1880.  As a result, my mother and her father, were born with the surname of Sowerby, but her Grandfather had the surname Mordue.  There was no official adoption, but the children went by the name of their stepfather.

Gary,
 
I appreciate your input & explanation of how  children end up with a surname other than their biological father's. However, I disagree with you on "we know that the assumption that cousins share the same grandparents is usually true." This relationship is still based on an assumption of what we perceive to be true or not true. We can assume but either way it isn't scientific proof. 60 Minutes said Vy's connection to Marion was through her cousin James West's DNA test. What I conclude from this is that James & Marion have a proven link to a common ancestor but Vy's relationship to both James & Marion is assumed because there was no test done to prove this same relationship. I'm not saying she isn't related or she is related to these men, I don't know. 60 Minutes implied James West's test was proof of the same relationship for Vy to Marion but to me this was misleading. Her relationship is still an assumed one to both men. It was a heart warming story & I enjoyed seeing these families enjoying one another's company. 
 
The segment said Vy & her daughter had mtdna tests done to trace their African roots.

It appears to me that Daniel is the only source for our DNA in this country, and that he did not arrive with any male relatives.
 
I remember reading of speculation that perhaps one or more of the Robinsons, on the John & Sara was related to Daniel Robins.  If so, we should see a cluster of Robinsons, (or some derivative surname) as a genetic match.  The only explanation for not finding such DNA matches would be that no descendents have tested to date, or all of these other Robinsons had died without any male children.
 
It is difficult for me to believe that when 20 of the 60 that have tested in the Robbins DNA project have proven to be a match, that we can't find 1 match out of the 135 that have tested in the Robinson DNA project,... if Daniel had a Robinson relative come to America with him.  Also the fact that all of the Robins matches seem to trace back to Daniel & Hope, belies the claim that Daniel was a descendent of a son John and Hester, as we would then have multiple roots for matching Robbins/Robins DNA in this country.

I agree with about 80% of what Gary has observed.  I do believe that all Robins/Robbins DNA samples that match samples from  known descendants of Daniel and Hope (Potter) Robins are also  descendants of Daniel and Hope. Usually, I would use a more cautious  statement such as "they share a common ancestor with descendants of  Daniel Robins". However with Daniel Robins there are some unusual  markers plus a change of name that I believe allows us to declare the  matching samples are descendants of Daniel Robins. For a Robbins to  closely match the DNA of known Daniel Robins descendants and yet not be  another descendant of Daniel Robins would require either: another  kindred Robison or Robinson family in colonial America to also have  shortened the name to Robins, or - new evidence to prove Daniel was not  really a Robison, Robinson, etc.  But participants in a surname DNA project are not randomly selected and  are not a representative cross section of the entire population. We who  are interested in genetic genealogy tend to recruit participants that we  hope will yield results that prove helpful to our research. I would not  conclude that a third of all Robbins in America are descendants of  Daniel Robins just because a third of the participants in the Robbins  DNA project are descendants of Daniel Robins. Likewise I'm not yet  convinced that 135 Robinsons are a sufficient number of participants to  allow us to conclude that Daniel Robins had no kin in America.

Gary,
 
Your frustration is understandable with such a common name as Robinson & its' variety of spellings. The failure to find a match with only 135 Robinson surnames in the database can't be that unusual in comparison to the millions of Robinsons, Robins, Robbins who haven't tested.
A couple of comments on John & Hester Robins of Theddingworth, England. I don't find any serious researcher currently who makes the claim that the John Robins family relates to the Daniel Robins of NJ.  The extraction by Robbins researchers of English Parish records & the wills of John Robins & sons very clearly indicate this is inaccurate. I think I posted a transcribed copy of John of Theddingworth' s will here sometime ago.
 
Daniel Robinson of the ship John & Sarah began his journey with six other men with the same surname. We can assume they were related but not necessarily a fact. I'm going to post some of my research notes on the six Scotsmen of the ship John & Sarah in the file section. Maybe the notes can be used for future reference & research.

I had a problem posting this in the file section.  PROFILES ON THE ROBINSON PRISONERS OF WAR  The following is my research on the six Robinson/Robertson Scottish  prisoners of war who accompanied Daniell Robinson on the ship John &  Sarah to America. All seven men were captured at the Battle of  Worcester & exiled to the New England Colonies in 1651/2.  David Dobson, Scottish historian, researcher & author writes there  were very few Scots in the New England colonies before 1651 when they  were banished there by Cromwell. Source: Works of David Dobson &  personal correspondence with Mr. Dobson.  The spelling of the name Robinson is English not Scottish.  1. Alester Robinson. A birth record for Alester Robertsone born May  26, 1628 in Alyth Parish, County of Perth, Scotland son of Patricke  Robertsone was located in the Scotland National Archives. If he was  the same Alester Robinson of the ship John & Sarah, he would have  been was 23 years old in 1651. John D. Grainger's "The Last Anglo- Scottish War, 1650-1652" pub 1939, pg. 94, 105, states a group of  archers were recruited from Perth between June 4 & July 31, 1651.  Alester Robinson has not been found in the records of New England,  Barbados or the southern colonies. Not all of the Scots on the ship  John & Sarah survived the voyage to America. Those sold to the Saugus  ironworks were forced to make a two day march from Gravesend to the  Lynn, MA ironworks. This occurred during the winter and many died on  the way. Possibly this was the fate of the ones that leave no record.  2. Charles Robinson. At this time a profile for him has not been  discovered in New England, Barbados or other American colonies.  3. James Robinson. He was an iron worker who was called as a witness  to a court case involving the Saugus Ironworks on March 31, 1657. The  court records state Mr. Robinson was 38 yrs old in 1657 making him 32  years of age in 1651. Records & Files of the Quarterly Courts of  Essex Co., MA, Vol. 2, pg 29.  The court records of Suffolk Co 1671-1680, show a James Robinson was  sued on April 27, 1675 by Robert Edmonds for nonpayment of 50 pounds  of fish, wheat and beef. He had a jury trial & the court records  refer to him as "James Robbinson alias James Robertson."  Source: Records of the Suffolk Co. Court 1671-1680. No record has been discovered that directly states he was the same  James Robinson of the ship John & Sarah. There may be descendants for  this man.

Harley,  University of Oklahoma Press, 1957. Saugus Iron Works National  Historic Site, Essex Co., MA.  4. John Robinson.

A  profile for this John Robinson has not been located in New England or  Barbados.  5. John Robinson. The 2nd man named John Robinson.

Thanks, I seem to remember finding that info previously when I did  extensive Google searching.  As a some-time social historian (wrote and published a master's thesis  on an era in 20th century U.S. domestic history), I'm not sure how  common sodomy and bestiality were, but I do know that premarital  relations were fairly common. Someone did a study comparing marriage  dates to birthdates (I think during mid-1700s in the colonies), and  they found that a majority of the women were pregnant when they got  married.  There does seem to be a correlation between strict social and sexual  mores as dictated by religious fundamentalism and deviant sexual  behavior...perhaps as a form of rebellion? Thanks for the info.  Barbara Wunder Hynes

The group's file has a file on William Robbins compiled by member Jim Robbins. I think your Mary Robbins is mentioned as William's daughter. We have had previous discussions on William b. 1724 on this forum & his birthplace. You may want to review these messages. Although the file gives his birthplace as Chedworth, England there is no reliable documentation to suppport it as Jim has stated. William Robins appears to be a descendant of Daniel & Hope Potter Robins.

[Robbinsfamilysouthjersey] GENETIC GENEALOGY & THE 5-RICHARD DESCENDANTS
From:
turkeypt2 <july37@cox.net>
View Contact
To:
Robbinsfamilysouthjersey@yahoogroups.com 


During the past several months I've been working on YDNA testing for  the 5-Richard line. At this time we have three 5-Richard males, two  from the David Robbins line & one from the Levi Robbins line (all  with a well documented ancestry to Daniel Robins)tested & these three  match each other. They do not match the test results of the three  males two from the 10-Aaron line & one from the 11-Benjamin line also  with documented ancestry to Daniel Robins. The group with limited  documentation to Daniel Robins matches the two from 10-Aaron & the  one from 11-Benjamin. One additional male tested from the 10-Aaron  line with a well documented ancestry to Daniel Robins does not match  the other two 10-Aaron or any of the above Robbins males. To my  knowledge there are no known well documented descendants who have  tested from the lines of 2-Daniel, 4-Joseph & 8-Moses.  For over 300 years the descendants of Richard Robins b. Feb. 14,  1673/4 at Woodbridge, NJ & died Sept. 23, 1715 at Cohansey, NJ  believed they were the descendants of Daniel Robins based on original  records, a well documented genealogy & a consistent oral history.  However, YDNA testing disputes this claim for the lines of the two  sons of John Robbins, Jr. David & Levi. A false paternity event (FPE)  appears to have occurred somewhere in the first four generations  after 1-Daniel. No testing has been done on David & Levi's brothers'  lines of John 3rd & Richard. These lines should be tested in order to  be as thorough as possible but my expectations are they will match  David & Levi. Until testing for them occurs we will assume their  lines & those of the daughters of John Robbins, Jr. (1755-1823) match  their brothers.  YDNA testing is unable to confirm the relationship of the daughters  of 5-Richard, Richard, Jr. & John Robbins, Sr. to Daniel & Hope  Robins. However, this test does give the descendants of the David &  Levi lines the scientific proof that they are not related to the  Daniel Robins group.  The discovery of the 5-Richard FPE is an excellent example of how the  best of documentation offers no proof of an accurate relationship to  a common ancestor without the supporting evidence of DNA. The  possibility for undetected false paternity events in family histories  may be greater than genealogists would like to believe or are able to  recognize. For most people there is no real assurance a FPE doesn't  lurk someplace in their ancestral line.  Tamara's website shows 23 Robbins males with matching YDNA. This  group is able to scientifically prove a relationship to a common  ancestor. However, there is no direct scientific proof for anyone  else of this same relationship unless it is verified by their own  DNA. Since it is impossible for many descendants to gain this same  certainty through their own testing, the relationship to a common  ancestor rests on documentation or a presumed relationship based on  another's YDNA test.  Finding qualified participants for the 5-Richard project was a  difficult task so I'm very grateful to the males who were willing to  test. Their tests have proved to be of great significance to our  Robbins family history. Hopefully the Richard Robbins descendants  will take this information & continue to use genetic genealogy to put  all their DNA puzzle pieces in place. At this time there are no  reliable matches in the databases for the Richard Robbins males.  Sara

We know that our James Robbins was born somewhere in the United States around 1787.  He married Elizabeth (Bessie) Gilbert, birth date and place unknown. They settled at  Canboro, Canborough Township in Haldimand County, Upper Canada (now Ontario,  Canada). Here we find their family according to the 1852 and 1861 Census of Canada  West.   In 1861 James, listed as a widower, was living with his daughter, Lyda Heaslip nee Robbins  b. ca 1823 at Canboro.   Nearby we find a son, Eli b. 1819 Upper Canada m. Repzy (Rossepa);   Hezekiah b. 1826 Gainsborough Tp., Haldimand Co., m. Martha Crossett b. 22 Jan 1828,  Bayham Tp., Elgin Co., Upper Canada.   My GG Grandfather, Leonard Robbins/Robins gave 1832 b. Canborough Tp at the time of  his second marriage. We also suspect he could have been born in 1827. His first marriage  was to Sussanah Bassindale, b. 1834, England, my GG Grandmother. She died in 1872  leaving a family of 6 living children. James then married a widow, Phebe House nee  Furler. They had at least 6 chidren.   There is also an Eliza Robbins, b. 1829 Upper Canada, that may be a daughter.   A growing team researching this family history has a more complete picture of the above  siblings and their succeeding generations but we all would appreciate knowing the  American roots of James Robbins.

Sara,  Please do enjoy your American Thanksgiving. We celebrated a wonderful Canadian  Thanksgiving on the 8th of October. I have some fond memories of being welcomed into  the homes of several families to celebrate your Thanksgiving during my undergraduate  years in New Mexico and Ohio.   Your suggestion for DNA testing of a living male Robbins/Robins made me think - what  living male with those surnames in the Canadian team. None are family historians known  to our research network. The last living Robbins I recall was my Great Uncle, John Hezekiah  "Hez" Robbins. Being called "Uncle Hez" from Welland, Ontario, that name struck me as  most unusual but very biblical. Hez and his wife, Malinda, were visiting his three sisters in  Waterford when I was a young lad. They called in at the "Village Reeves" home to visit their  nephew and niece, my Grandparents, Russ and Lottie Aspden. Pop and Nana had a large  mixed garden so a tour was alawys appreciated by any visitors. He would be the last living  Robbins male I knew personally. Malinda died in 1950 and Hez on 1 Jan 1953 in Niagara  Falls, Ontario, Canada.  Decades latter, it appears one of Hez and Malinda's family put a gedcom.file into  Ancestry.com Family Trees section called, "Robbins Family of Niagara, Haldimand, Norfolk  and Brant". What a wonderful find. But any attempt to find the cousin who submitted it  have come up empty. The last entry was in 2003. If there is a living male Robbins, he  would be most likely found in Uncle Hez's family.   Yes there are Robbins/Robbins families in Canada. Many came from the States but also  some came directly from England and Scotland.   In the mean time, I have been thoroughly enjoying exploring the groups postings. Many  leads have opened up and links have been followed to learn more about New Jersey. The  other aspect of our research interest come with Hez's half sister, Ada Robbins marrying  James Walker "Jimmy" Robins of Windham Tp., Norfolk Co., Ontario. Their farm outside of  Waterford appears to be the homestead of the "Robins". We are trying to determine the  connection of Jimmy's Robins with those Robins who have been the focus of recent Gen  Forum postings between Val King and Peggy Robbins (See October 2007 Robins Family  Genealogy Forum).  That's it for now. Murray (And have some Pumpking Pie for me)  --- In Robbinsfamilysouthj ersey@yahoogroup s.com, "turkeypt2" <july37@...> wrote:  Murray,  Thanks for posting your genealogy on James Robbins b. 1787 in the USA.A suggestion  that may help to solve or assist with solving your Robbins American roots would be YDNA  testing. You indicate you have a team of researchers for your family, if you have a male in  this group that carries the Robins or Robbins surname they would be eligible for testing.  Possibly you can find a match from this test & in the long run save a lot of time, effort &  expense.

I have sponsored a couple of the Robbins family tests and I administer a project for my own surname. I hope that makes me someone who has opinions worth sharing.  Yes it does matter what company is used. Although the results should be the same regardless of testing facility, the purpose of DNA testing is comparison with other results. The Robbins DNA Project is hosted by Family Tree DNA and by testing with that company you can see how you compare with other participants in the Robbins DNA Project.. Also, there is a $ discount when participating in a hosted surname project vs solo testing.  There are some publicly accessible databases (ysearch.org, ybase.org, smgf.org) hosted by testing companies but the first two are voluntarily updated by tested individuals and do not include all results collected by a surname project. Ysearch.org is the largest and many of the entries on ybase.org are redundant. Smgf.org database is different in that it is maintained by SMGF which does not host surname projects, and you are not given any contact information, but the results posted here are usually not redundant.  Although 12 markers are often enough to determine if a Robbins is a likely descendant of Daniel Robins of NJ, this is only because this family has some unusual combinations of unusual marker values. Ordinarily, 25 markers are needed to eliminate random matches. More markers also supposedly help identify branches within a family, but so far this advantage is only seen among the results for one of the Southern branches of Daniel Robins descendants. However, not enough Robbins participants have opted for the 67 marker testing to conclude if any more branches can be identified within that expanded panel of markers.  Some of your "how to" questions may be answered on the testing company web sites such as http://www.ftdna. com You also might want to check the International Society of Genetic Genealogists web site at http://www.isogg. org And I have a few simple explanations on my surname project web site at http://german. jarman.net/ dna.htm  I hope I've helped answer some of your questions, and I do recommend you find a male Robbins in your family to test. I found learning which family shares an ancestor with the Robbins family I am researching very helpful in both focusing my traditional efforts and debunking a fairy tale about a Southern Robbins family's origin.

Hello, all:
 
I recently posted a message to a Rootsweb mailing list to see what more I could learn about "my" Abigail Robbins' father, Joseph Robbins "Jr." (Joseph-Moses- Daniel). The quality of the responses pleased and surprised me. He was evidently quite an active guy in Edgmont (Chester Co), PA. I've seen little discussion of him either on this list, Rootsweb's Robbins mail list, or elsewhere, for that matter. 
 
Joseph Robbins Jr. is barely mentioned in a short 1940 family history I once e-mailed to this list, entitled, "The Robbins of Covell's Hill". I suspect he has been under-researched, partly because he had few patrilineal descendants. While I had previously seen a list of his and Jane (Hoopes) Robbins' children, it didn't dawn on me until now that, with eleven daughters, we may have many, many living cousins from this line, few (if any) of whom would be named Robbins. 
 
I'm curious--are there any other descendants of his who subscribe to this list?
 
If I'm right that this family is lightly researched in Robbins circles, it may also be due to its odd migration pattern: Joseph left NJ before 1768, and may have spent the remainder of his long life in PA. Two of Joseph's brothers (Richard and Zebulon) appear to have migrated to PA with him. But at least one of his PA-born and raised daughters, Abigail, "returned" to the NJ homestead some 50 years after Joseph left, and she evidently brought her elderly Pennsylvanian mother, Jane (Hoopes) Robbins, with her.  
 
I'll be sending more questions to the PA-Old-Chester mail list, but I thought I'd point out the thread to you now, so anyone interested could jump in while the discussion is active. You can see my query (and the replies at the bottom) at:

John,
 
Your knowledge of the DNA process is highly regarded & respected by those of us who are involved with the Robbins family DNA testing. I appreciate all the support & expert advice you have given me along the way with the testing of the Richard Robins line. Your message of Nov. 21st was delayed by Yahoo & apparently was stuck in their Spam file. It just came to my attention this a.m. I have no idea why it took so long for the message to arrive on the site.
 
Thank you for answering questions on the subject of DNA.
                                 Sara

Further information on my Robbins/Bronson line in Pennsylvania.    Blacklick Township, Indiana County, Pennsylvania 1807 Tax list:  James Brunson (mulatto) John Robbins Sr. (shoemaker)  Blacklick Township, Indiana County, Pennsylvania 1810 Census:  John Robins Sr. 2 males under 10; 1 male under 16; 2 males 16-25; 1 male 26-45 2 females under 10; 1 female under 16; 1 female 16-25 (father of John Robbins Jr. 1800-1884 who married Elizabeth Bronson  1804-1874) This John Robbins only listed 2 sons, Daniel & Ezeikiel, in his will;  however, had a lot more sons than that as by census record. Also,  James Robbins, age 25 in 1850 census of Mercer County, Penn. also  listed as a shoemaker; son of John & Elizabeth Bronson Robbins.   1810 census Chenago Township, Mercer County, Pennsylvania page 915 text:  Thomas Bronson (further record from a fellow researcher says wife's name was a Mary;  but unproven as last name of Thompson. And when James Robbins  remained in Mercer County, Penn. before following his family to Iowa,  in 1850 census, was listed right behind another mulatto family of  Thompson...Samuel with wife Lucy and children Abner, Elizabeth, and  Albert.)  Believe this is same Thomas Bronston who is listed as mixed-blood and  one whose house burnt down in 1820; and father of Elizabeth Bronson,  wife of John Robbins Jr.  Blacklick Township, Indiana County, Pennsylvania 1820 census:  Col. James Bronson John Robbins Sr.  (can only surmise James Bronson served in some military organization  and returned home by 1820; And father of Thomas Bronston/Bronson. )  Cannot find anything about Thomas Bronston/Bronson after 1820.   Believe the Bronson and Robbins families lived near each other in  Indiana County, Penn.; and children married and moved on to Mercer  County, Penn.  And Mulatto is for being Native American.  Steven Russell

A Susan Hutson claims she too is related to Thomas Bronston, through sons who went to Kentucky. And that some Robbins were also Native American or mulatto. 
 
Thomas Bronson is in the 1810, 1820 and 1830 census in Mercer Co and then died in 1831. 
Remember that Thos's sons, Joseph, John, James and Henry spelled their names Brunson and Bronson. They are in the 1830 (Joseph) and later censuses
 
Sons Thomas and Jacob spelled it Bronston (except Jacob signed deeds Brownston). 
Thomas Springer Bronston of KY says on his grave BORN NEAR CHAMBERSURG PENN
 
Therfore I have inferred that Thomas Bronson/Bronston of Mercer Co PA who in 1810 census  showed "8 other free people"  MAY HAVE BEEN the same Thomas Brownston who lived in Franklin Co PA in 1790 census ("8 other free people").   
 
If I am right then your Elizabeth would have been born in Franklin Co along with Jacob  <1791, Thomas Springer Bronston 1791, Joseph 1801 and (and a new lead shows maybe Sarah 1804 and Mary 1805).  I will send more on my wild conjecture later.
 
Thomas bought land in Mercer Co after Geo. Shilling came there in 1814.  Thomas and Jacob were already in KY by then.  
 
Please put me in touch with your fellow researcher who gave you the Mary Thompson lead.  WAS SHE HIS SECOND WIFE?
