Here's my dead end. John was born in Warren Co, NJ in 1788 and married  in Sussex Co in 1811. He died and is buried in Oakland Co, MI. The  marriage I can verify, and the death and burial are confirmed, but I  can't find his birth or his parents. Someone in my family thinks his  father might be Thomas Robbins. But of course, there is no other data  as to why or how they came up with this. His wife was Elinor (Ellen)  Vliet, dau. of William B Vliet (Priv in war).   I have been told the family moved to Oakland Co., Mi in the 1830's.  Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.

Thanks for the reply, but that John Robbins can't be mine.  My John Robbins and his wife are both buried in Oakhill Cemetery in Pontiac, Oakland Co., MI. Although I do have other relatives from Hunterdon Co..  After I sent my question in I found the data on when Warren County was founded.  Perhaps Independence Township would help.  That's where he's supposed to have been born.  Looking through my notes - they moved to Michigan in 1837, all 5 of their children were born in New Jersey.  The children were  Daniel Vliet Robbins, William V Robbins, Melinda Robbins, Hanna Robbins, and Nancy Robbins. Their mother was Elinore (Ellen) Vliet.  Her grandfather was Capt. Daniel Vliet who died in 18180 in Bethlehem Twp, Hunterdon Co., NJ.  The Vliet line was pretty easy to find, but the Robbins are all over the place.  Does any of this sound familiar?

I have found a lot of detail on the Robbins from John Robbins to my family in Michigan, but nothing about his siblings, or possible parents or other relatives.  But I will pursue the Jonathan Robins line and see if there a chance they could be connected in someway.  Thanks for all your great suggestions.

I was wondering if you had come across any information regarding the brothers Daniel and John Robbins who were born in Sussex Co,NJ circa 1760, and later left to remove west with families and died in Scioto Co, Ohio in abt 1835? They lived for a brief time in Washington Co, Pa and later Fayette Co, Pa. John and Daniel both served in the Washington Co, Pa Militia during the Revolutionary War. I have copies of John's service record as well as some other documents from the Washington DC archives.  Although he is not a direct line ancestor, by association with his contemporary cousins, who are my ancestors, I hope to draw the circle tighter upon who the one remaining grandfather (and his wife) was.  Thanks, Brian Robbins

Brian,
It is such a quandry with those Daniel and John Robbins of western PA. What can we cite for evidence that they were truly the same two in Fayette? They did not stay long. I see that only my William b. 1761 is still there in 1800-1810 decade. Although he did serve in NJ in the Revolution, I have NO clues where William is in the time after discharge in 1783 to 1789, when he marries in eastern PA at the church in Neshaminy. There are several Williams to account for at that time.
 
 Therefore : his Father would HAVE to be born 1740 or before. That narrows the search. I have no clues among the several Williams born about 1759-60-61.  Further, one or more may have married more than once. 
 
There is also the problem of the DNA showing my line is more nearly matched to the group in NC with Vickery connections. These removed to Indiana. Such problems. I must continue reading the land records, claims, probates in Fayette , and probably the earlier counties as well.
One wonders if these folks had couble lives.
June

Here is possibly another connection between the Robbins and Vliets families in Warren Co. NJ. 
 
Jonathan Robbins and Daniel Vliet both are listed in 1829 as "Assembly" as members of legislature for Warren Co.  The next year 1830 Jonathan is listed as "Council" and Daniel is listed as Assembly.  Jonathan continued as "Council" in 1831, but Daniel was not listed.
 
In 1832, Garret Vliet and Daniel Vliet (also 1828 and 1837 for Daniel) are listed as "Judges of the Court of Common Pleas", I believe this is for the Warren County Bible Society.  Apparently Daniel Vliet was the moderator at the forming of the Warren County Bible Society. It was formed by the Presbyterian Church in Danville NJ.

I think that the Jonathan Robbins that is mentioned in the Assembly is Jonathan Robbins b. in 1774.  He was a prominent man in Warren County around that time.  I descend from that Jonathan Robbins and also from the Vliet family.  I have searched both lines and do not find that they merge at any time.  I do not have anything on the Jonathan Robbins who was b. in 1788.  Could you tell me who he married in Sussex County in 1811.  That might help me look him up.

My Great-great- great-great Grandfather was John Robbins b Oct 11, 1788 in Independence Township, Sussex County, NJ.  He was married on Sep 26, 1811 in Sussex Co., NJ to Ellinor (Ellen) Vliet b Apr 10, 1790 NJ d mar 18, 1848 in Pontiac, Oakland Co., Mi.  She was the dau. of Priv. William B Vliet b 1756 prob Sussex Co., NJ d 1839 Townsbury, Warren Co., NJ. Her mother was Annie Wilson b 1763 NJ d 1815 NJ.  
 
I am trying to identify John Robbins'  parents.  The best lead so far is a Jonathan Robbins who may be a brother or more likely a cousin as both are living in the same area at about the same time.  
 
In searching down Jonathan Robbins, his line does go back to some other names in Ct and Eng. my grandfather said were in the family tree but I could never connect.  But without the connection to Jonathan, it is just speculation. Unfortunately, my grandfather died young and never documented where he found the information he had listed as his family tree. His list went back to John Robbins and Hester ? in England.
 
Of course, the other thought is that perhaps John Robbins' father could have been Jonathan Robbins Sr, as I have found Jonathan Jr listed in several places. Oh well, still searching.

 I have The Messenger Press November 14, 1940 noted as a source for  the birth & death date for John Robbins.  I have also sourced the same for info on Ann Ivins Robbins and the death of both Joseph and Leah Clayton Robbins.  The same is also sourced for identifying the children of Joseph and Leah as Margaret, Zebulon, Moses, Mary, Joseph, Richard, Parthenig, Sarah, Elisabeth, Meribah and John.  Probably only makes things worse but sometimes info you save crops up later. Sam

How is Jonathon Robins a Jr when his fathers name is John?  The only child I have listed for John Robins and Anne Ivins is Isaac Ivans Robins.  Course that doesn't mean there weren't any others, but I have to be suspicious of the entire list of facts, when one of those facts states that someone was born in New Haven Ct 19 years before the town was founded.

It has always been my understanding that the Jonathan Robbins  referred to as Col. Jonathan Robbins is the one b. in 1774. He  served in the War of 1812. Also, Jr. did not mean in the older times what it means today.  Sometimes, a person was named Jr. for a grandfather or someone else  in the family, not his father. For instance, I have a Joseph Carter who named his son, Henry Carter,  Jr. Henry Carter (Sr.) was Jr.'s gr-grandfather. Judy Arthur

Gary,
 
1st the Jonathan Robins Jr. was how I found it on the net - I have not validated anything - I don't know if he even connects to my line yet.  I can only question if his father's name was Jonathan at birth and changed to John.  Again speculation - not validated.  
 
As for Richard Robbins being born in New Haven Ct, my typing error, it should have been born in Wethersfield, New Haven Co., Ct.  Also not validated.  If I can't list these items on this forum where can I.  
 
I don't need to be sniped at for trying to find information and sharing it.  You may be an old hand at this type of internet stuff, I'm not - but you certainly don't encourage me to continue here with that kind of an attitude.

Sylvia:
 
I apologize for the lack of thought put into my earlier reply.  Please forgive me.
 
Some comments,
 
I do often forget, and am often reminded by members of this group that use of the words Junior & Senior did not always mean father and son in those days.  Yet almost every time I see it I want to make that association.
 
It has been my experience that the names John and Jonathon were considered two different and distinct names in those days.  I have come to this conclusion mainly due to the fact that my line has numerous instances of brothers with those names.
 
As for the birth place of Daniels father, I don't think anyone knows for sure.   Sara comes closest with references from the family bible of one of Daniels grandsons.  It appears to me that people often use the ancestral files, pedigree files and the IGI at familysearch. org as a source for their information.  It is my feeling that the information from those files needs to be used with extreme care and validated.  While I have no personal experience in the creation of those files, it appears that inadequate controls are in place in the form of requiring  that submitters provide documentation to support the data they input.  The data often appears to be no more than someone's best guess and too often may contain errors.  For example you can find references to people being born in New Haven, (and probably Wethersfield) before the towns were founded.  New Haven was founded around 1638 and Wethersfield claiming to be "Ye Most Auncient Towne" in Connecticut was founded around 1633 or1634.
 
Hope Potter Robins death is also widely misreported as being 1687.  I have no idea where that date comes from but it appears that Hope was alive at least 8 years later than that.  A document dated Jan 31, 1695 contains this statement which I believe is attributed to Samuel Dennes:
 
"personally came before me.  Hope the wife of the above sayd Daniell Robins And freely gave her consent to the within deede of Sale to Adam Hude, And freely gaved up all her Right tittle and claim that she at present hath or hereafter might have or heirs to have to the within mentioned & sold premisses"

I've had some private inquires about the reason for the group poll &  will answer to the entire group.  By asking everyone to express their opinion we are able to get an idea  of how helpful this site is to all of you. We don't want the group to  become weighted down by a lot of uninterested & disatisfied people. We  have recently removed 9 members from the list for invalid e-mail  addresses & duplicate addresses. This reduces the group from 74 to 65  members. We are pleased with the response we have had from the group.  As of today 43 members out of 65 have responded by poll or have  communicated with me directly. Thanks very much, your opinions are  greatly appreciated. This leaves 22 members who haven't responded. Just  so there is no misunderstanding, I want to make everyone aware that ALL  members who fall into the NO RESPONSE category will be removed from the  group after Feb 4th. If you have any other questions please let me know.  Sara

I followed the Garrison line to today and some are in this group. Johnston's paternal grandmother is Dinah Robins(1772- 1857). She had married James Garrison(1767- 1825).  Since I joined the group many have come forth with information on Robbins/Robins that have helped my search. AND, I think the exchange in this group is one of the best.   That's my polling two cents....  Dorman Nelson Biographer www.johnlivereating johnston. com

Josephine,  Sometime ago you had shared with me that you had been researching the  parents of Naomi Peterson wife of your ancestor Stephen Ladow b. abt.  1778 s/o Ambrose Ladow & Rachel Robbins. While researching my  Peterson line & I discovered a Naomi Peterson b. abt. 1782 d/o Aaron  & Martha Hollingshead Peterson & sister of my ancestor Aaron Peterson  b. 1780 in Newport, Cumberland Co., NJ. I believe this Naomi Peterson  is Stephen Ladow's wife although I don't have any documentation that  this same Naomi Peterson married a Ladow but there is the Cumberland  Co., NJ marriage record of Stephen Ladow to Naomi Peterson on May 25,  1805. Both the Ladow & Peterson families lived close to each other.  The Aaron/Aron Peterson line goes back to Sweden to Mans Petersson  Stake who came to America (New Sweden) on the ship Eagle (Orn) with  Gov. Rising in 1654 as his provost marshall. His son Peter Peterson  settled on 920 acres along the Maurice River. The early history of  this Peterson line can be found in the The 1693 Census of the Swedes  on the Delaware by Dr. Peter Stebbins Craig pub. in 1993.  It's interesting to discover that the name Peterson used by our  family since 1711 isn't the original name. Deeds show Mans Petersson  Stake's son Peter went by several names. Dr. Craig writes, " not  infrequently sons frequently adopted (or were called by) their  father's patronymic. Thus Peter, the son of Mans Petersson Stake, was  called Peter Mannson, Peter Petersson & Peter Stake in contemporary  records. He died as Peter Peterson which became his family's  surname." Common first names used by the Swedes evolved into Englsh  substitutes which were not always literal translations.  Anders/Andrew/ Mans/Moses/ Lars/Lawrence etc. Although our Peterson  line believed they were of Swedish origin this isn't entirely  accurate either. According to Dr Craig's research Man Petersson Stake  was a Finn not a Swede. 17th century Finland was part of the Kingdom  of Sweden. Dr. Craig says the Finn's who came to New Sweden on the  Delaware were from provinces in present Sweden primarily Varmland.   Josephine you & I may be the only Ladow/Robbins/ Peterson descendants  in this group. However, I hope others will at least find the 17  century patronymic naming system of the Swedes & how surnames can  totally change from the original to be of some interest.  Sara

Carol,
 
Your comments are appreciated. The Ladow name is another that evolved a little over the years. Ladieu, Ladieux, Ladue, Ladow etc. It appears to be French in origin but I don't really know if research has been done to connect the family to the place of origin. The Robbins & Lore families continued to use it as a middle name up to about 1910. Thanks for letting us know you enjoy the group discussions & that you find things that are relevant to your research here.
 
                                        Sara
 
 Thank you for posting the patronymic naming system of the Swedes.  As a Steelman descendant, I am always interested in the Swedes and how these names evolve.  I'm not currently working on any of my Robbins connections, but I have many ancestors connected to south Jersey lines.  The postings on this list are relevant to many of them.  Ladow is one that always interests me.  I appreciate the added information.  I haven't had anything to offer recently, but I enjoy all the discussions among the list members.  Carol

Thanks, Sara, for posting on the group. Just to refresh everyone.... My John Robbins married Eliz. Bronson in Mercer County, Penn.
 
Eliz. Bronson dau. of Thomas Bronston of Mercer County. Also could be spelled Branston. Also probable Native American blood.
 
John Robbins son of John Robbins & Eliz. Repine of Blacklick Township, Indiana County, Penn.
 
All Robbins were Quakers. And most shoemakers.

As to James Robbins and Lucetta Doss, I recall seeing them mentioned in the Jackson Co Iowa records. Was it Lucetta Doss who married in Jackson Co. or were they married before they settled there? In particular I found they were NOT related to those Robbins brothers from IN and OH named Daniel M Robbins, and his wife Charity Paramore along with his brother Hanson M. Robbins and wife Jane Ferguson. Daniel settled in Farmers Creek township in 1850. Daniel M. and family remained there 1850-1870. Did Lucetta Doss remain in IA? I recall seeing that a diary or similar journal type record or Bible was entered in a Wisconsin historical group's accession list. Possibly the Doss entry would pop up on a title entry query? Several Iowa families moved over the Mississippi to the Wisconsin side for the second generation, many others "went West"  Have you checked land records there just in case?

June:  Thanks for the message and the inquiry. Yes, James Robbins & Lucetta Doss married in Jackson County, Iowa May 12, 1855. Town of Fulton. Later moved to Center point, Linn County, Iowa to be with the rest of the family. In 1862 when James Robbins enlisted in the 20th. Iowa regiment, they were living in Cedar Rapids where James was a shoemaker. Later lived out their lives in Center Point after the war. Lucetta died 1887; James in 1889.
 
There were other Robbins in and around Linn County, Iowa before and after the civil war, but have found no connections with my own. Some I believe came from Canada. 
 
Lucetta Doss dau. of Greenberry and Eliza Mikels Doss. From Indiana. Greenberry born in Hardin County,  Kentucky in 1813. Same County where Abraham Lincoln was born and lived until 1820.  The Doss line goes back to a John Doss and Ann Taylor of Middlesex County, Virginia in 1650s.

Donna & Kurt,  The relationship between Hugh D. Bowker b. 1847-1930 & Theresa J.  Thompson Robbins d/o of Dare S. & Rachel Fowler Thompson may be as  follows: Theresa's aunt Susan Thompson married Anthony Austin. Their  oldest child was recorded as Ainat Austin in The Shropshire Family of  Cumberland Co., NJ by Murray & Jean Harris, Gloucester Co.,  Historical Society, 1988. Could this be a misspelling for Anna since  Ainat seems to be a rather unusual name? Murray & Jean Harris give  their source for the Austin family information as The Genealogy of  John Williams & Thankful Barlow, Banajah Tomson & Prudence Eldredge  by Charles Tomlin, Cape May Court House & Clarence R. Brooks, Phila,  1931. The time frame fits for Susan Thompson Austin born in 1804 &  Anna Austin born 1824 to be mother & daughter. Hugh D. Bowker's  mother was Anna Austin w/o Francis Bowker. If Ainat is Anna then  Theresa Thompson Robbins & Anna Austin Bowker were first cousins.  The Robbins/Bowker relationship is Hugh D. Bowker's sisters Catherine  Bowker married Levi Robbins, III & Mary Elizabeth Bowker married  Alexander T. Robbins. Theresa Thompson Robbins was Levi & Alex's step- mother. Sara

Sara,
 
I want to repeat what Donna has said.  Thank you for the information.  I'll have to go back and look at those references.  (I have those books in the closet somewhere.)
 
I found the obituary on Theresa Jane Thompson Robbins Collins dated 3/16/1930 from the Cumberland County Advertiser;
"Noth Port Norris - The funeral of Mrs. Jane Collins who died at the home of Hugh Bowker last Wednesday was held in the Haleysville M.E. church on Saturday afternoon.
The deceased was only a second cousin to Mr. Bowker and his maiden sister who reside at the Port Norris-North Port Norris forks of the road, but Mrs Collins seemed to feel so mauch at home with them that she spent her last days with them.
Prior to her illness she fell down the stairs and this, together with heart complications which so often overpower old age, caused her death.
Shw was the widow of the late Levi Robbins.  Leter she married Samuel Collins, about the year of 1900.  Mr Collins is now dead.
he was the mother and step-mother of 24 children and helped raise one family of granchildren, her youngest daughter dying at an early age and leaving several small children.  She was 86 Yeas of age.
Rev, John Bradway, with whom she was well acquainted, was in charge of the funeral, which was largely attended."

Kurt ,
 
Thanks for posting Theresa Thompson Robbins' obituary. You have a colorful ancestry through Theresa back to the legendary Prudence Eldredge aka Princess Snow Flower sister of the last Lenni Lenape chief King Nummi. The Thompsons aren't in my line so only know a little of the local folklore on them. I've been told that Lake Nummy near Woodbine was named after him & he is supposedly buried around Stone Harbor.

I recall reading in my notes that Chief Nummy might be buried on the site of the airport in Rio Grande/Villas.  I recall reading this from the Cape May County Archives on Rte 9.  Makes for interesting reading, though.  I called my daughter Princess Snow Flower when she was younger.  Now when I do it, she just rolls her eyes.  {;-)

Donna,
 
It does appear Ainit Austin is Anna Austin Bowker & Susan Thompson Austin was her mother. Hugh D. Bowker's line connects to the Lore & Robbins families through Hugh's wife Phebe Haley. She was the daughter of John Haley, Jr who was a descendant of Ruth Robbins Glann  d/o Richard Robbins, Jr. Phebe's mother was Hannah H. Lore, a descendant of John Lory of Cornwall, Eng ancestor of the Cumberland Co., NJ Lore family. Hugh & Phebe are buried in the Port Norris M.E. Cemetery. His maiden sister Emeline Bowker is buried there too in the plot of Sarah E. Mulvey b. 1848-d. 1915. I'm curious if Sarah Mulvey was related to the Bowkers.

Since the Richard Robins of Cohansey line tested I've been contacted by  a man with the surname Robbins who believes he is a descendant of a  John Robbins of Cape Cod. His DNA matches the Richard Robins of  Cohansey males at 11/12 markers. Since the Richard Robins males appear  to be his closest match, he thinks there is a relationship. Mr. Robbins  links his genealogy solely on H.N. Latey's 1917 booklet "The Robbins  Family of Cape Cod." I see no evidence to link the Richard Robins of  Cohansey line to John Robbins of Cape Cod. Mr. Robbins' idea of a  relationship to the Richard Robins males appears to stem from his match  at 11/12 markers. The following quote regarding 12 marker matches is  from John German to me, "the problem with 12 marker tests is they often  produce random false matches even with the same name and in this  instance its an 11/12 match." There's an album in the group's photo  area under "Robbins of Cape Cod" if anyone is interested is reading  the first three generations of the Cape Cod Robbins genealogy.   Sara

Brintnel moved to western PA before 1790. Mary Boardman is buried in the Long Run Presbyterian Church Cemetery located between East McKeesport & Irwin in Westmoreland Co., PA. 
 
Source: Fulton Family of Westmoreland Co, PA compiled by Ernest S. Craighead, Pittsburgh , PA , 1940
 
The Fulton Genealogy only names two of Brintnel & Mary Boardman Robbins children, William & Keziah. These two married into the Fulton family. Maybe Brian or someone else has the names of the other eight children. Locating a Robbins male from Steve's line for DNA testing if possible will answer if he is related to the Daniel Robins group.

From Portrait and Biographical Album of Woodford County, Illinois Chicago: Chapman Bros., 1889  Thomas Robbins, is a well-to-do farmer, and an honored resident of Linn Township, where he was raised since 1873. Though not an old settler of the county, he has become thoroughly identified with its agricultural interests, and has been eminently successful in the prosecution of his calling. He was born in North Huntington County, Pa., Feb. 2, 1836. His father, Brintnel Robbins, was a native of the same county, a son of Hezekiah Robbins, also a native of the Keystone State. Brintnel Robbins, the great-grandfather of the subject of this sketch, is supposed, from the best information we have at hand, to have been a native of New England, and was a pioneer of Westmoreland County, Pa. He took up a large tract of land bordering on the Youghiogheny River, and erected a mill, which he operated in connection with his farm labors, and resided there until his death. The grandfather had also a steam mill, and carried on a farm while managing it until about 1844. In that year he removed to Illinois, and located in Rock Island County, on Buffalo Prairie, where he improved a farm, on which he spent his last years. The maiden name of his wife was Wilson, and she was likewise a native of Pennsylvania. The father of the subject of this sketch, was reared and married in his native county, and was there engaged in agricultural pursuits until 1870, when he came to Illinois, and settled in Linn Township. He purchased a farm on section 7, which remained his home until his demise in 1883. The maiden name of his wife was Hannah Wiley, who was born in the same county as her husband, and was a daughter of Sampson and Nannie (McGrew) Wiley. She died on the home farm in 1875, where seven of their ten children were reared.   The subject of this biography was reared to agricultural pursuits in the home of his birth, residing with his parents until he attained manhood, and then commencing life on his own account by renting land in his native township. In 1865 he removed to Sewickly Township, dwelling there until 1873. At that time he concluded to come West to better his fortunes, so he sold the farm that he had purchased in that place and came to Woodford County. Here he bought the farm where he now resides, which is well improved, with substantial buildings, pleasantly located four miles southeast of the village of Washburn. In addition to his homestead, he has 160 acres of land, situated on sections 4 and 7, Linn Township, which is under excellent cultivation, and yields him a good income.   In 1860, Mr Robbins took unto himself a wife in the person of Miss Nancy Gant, a native of the same township and county as himself, and a daughter of William and Isabelle Gaut (sic). Three children have resulted from this union -- Mary Isabelle, Brintnell, and Hannah Rebecca.   That our subject is in prosperous circumstances, is due to the fact, aside from the valuable aid he has received from his wife, that he possesses a certain force of character and a capacity for performing whatever he attempts, and that he is blessed with accurate judgment and good powers of discrimination. He has in a good degree those traits that win the hearty esteem of all with whom he deals, and have gained him many life-long friends. A sound Republican in his politics, he cordially supports his party at the polls. Religiously, both he and his wife are members in high standing, of the United Presbyterian Church.

The Fulton Genealogy only names two of Brintnel & Mary Boardman Robbins children, William & Keziah. These two married into the Fulton family. Maybe Brian or someone else has the names of the other eight children. Locating a Robbins male from Steve's line for DNA testing if possible will answer if he is related to the Daniel Robins group.

This was forwarded to me & passing it along for the group. Sara  Deborah, The "brick wall" is not uncommon, but fortunately the DNA test  results  are a big help. The DNA runs down through the Robins/Robbins family of South New  Jersey.  In digging through census files this is the way it looks from here.  A William Edward Livingston was born in 1852 to Sarah Livingston.  Sarah shows up on the 1850 Census, 11^th District, Overton County, TN  at  age 26.  Her parents were Peter (44) and Patsy (Martha) Livingston (44). Sarah  was the oldest daughter.  Her siblings were Susan, 24; Matilda, 22; Thomas, 19; Mary, 17;  Patsy,  15; Nancy, 13 and James, 5. Also living with the Livingston family  was  Nancy Nation(s), age 1.  Sarah was living with her parents at this time. The Livingston  surname  was obviously Sarah's maiden name. William, her son wouldn't be born  until two years later.  The Nation surname was linked by marriage to the Robbins family that  had  settled in North Carolina.  I didn't find them in the 1860 Census.  By the 1870 Census, the Peter Livingston family was in Willow Springs  Twp., Howell County, MO.  Peter was 65; Martha (Patsy) was 65; Sarah was 44, and a William E.  Livingston, was 18 and his sister Mary was 7. Elisha Winningham, a  cousin, was 14. The rest of the Livingston children have disappeared,  scattered or whatever.  William E. Livingston shows up in Mt. Vernon Twp., Benton County, AR  on  the 1880 Census.  William E. is 28; his wife Mary Ann is 26; daughter Sarah is 4; son  William Elisha,1(shows as Elias, probably to allow name distinction  from  his cousin); William's mother Sarah, now 56, and William's sister,  Mary,  now 17; and cousin Elisha Winningham is 23. The Census shows Sarah as  William's mother and Mary as his sister.  Summary: It seems Sarah was a Livingston all her life. Her two  children  were Livingstons also. It appears she never married. Since the DNA  tests  show a 37 out of 37 match with a Robbins line that settled in South  Carolina and and a 37 out of 37 match with a Robbins line that traces  back to about 1829 in Randolph County, IL. Both Robbins lines, among  others trace back to Daniell and Hope (Potter) Robins who met and  married in New Haven Colony in the mid 1600's.  It appears that Sarah and an unknown Robbins gentleman were  acquainted  while living in Overton County TN. The Livingstons and the Robbins  were  two fine families that have origins in Scotland.  Now we need to identify Robbins male that donated the family DNA to  the  Livingston family. I would venture a guess that his name might be  William.  This is how it looks to me....I could be wrong. DNA research often  finds  a genetic line that crosses over several surname groups.  Please let me know if this helps or if someone else has better  information.  Thanks,  Pete Miller  chatman@suddenlink. net wrote: > Pete, > > I am happy to hear from you and please do share my information with  anyone > who could help us make a connection. > > Deborah > > -----Original Message----- > From: Personal [mailto:pete@digitalpath. net]  > Sent: Sunday, November 18, 2007 7:25 PM > To: chatman@suddenlink. net > Subject: Re: Message from a ysearch user >

 Contributed by member Bettylou Steadman Indian DNA Links to 6 'Founding Mothers' By MALCOLM RITTER (AP Science Writer) From Associated Press March 13, 2008 10:33 AM EDT  NEW YORK - Nearly all of today's Native Americans in North, Central  and South America can trace part of their ancestry to six women whose  descendants immigrated around 20,000 years ago, a DNA study suggests.  Those women left a particular DNA legacy that persists to today in  about about 95 percent of Native Americans, researchers said.  The finding does not mean that only these six women gave rise to the  migrants who crossed into North America from Asia in the initial  populating of the continent, said study co-author Ugo Perego.  The women lived between 18,000 and 21,000 years ago, though not  necessarily at exactly the same time, he said.  The work was published this week by the journal PLoS One. Perego is  from the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation in Salt Lake City  and the University of Pavia in Italy.  The work confirms previous indications of the six maternal lineages,  he said. But an expert unconnected with the study said the findings  left some questions unanswered.  Perego and his colleagues traced the history of a particular kind of  DNA that represents just a tiny fraction of the human genetic  material, and reflects only a piece of a person's ancestry.  This DNA is found in the mitochondria, the power plants of cells.  Unlike the DNA found in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed  along only by the mother. So it follows a lineage that connects a  person to his or her mother, then the mother's mother, and so on.  The researchers created a "family tree" that traces the different  mitochondrial DNA lineages found in today's Native Americans. By  noting mutations in each branch and applying a formula for how often  such mutations arise, they calculated how old each branch was. That  indicated when each branch arose in a single woman.  The six "founding mothers" apparently did not live in Asia because  the DNA signatures they left behind aren't found there, Perego said.  They probably lived in Beringia, the now-submerged land bridge that  stetched to North America, he said.  Connie Mulligan of the University of Florida, an anthropolgist who  studies the colonization of the Americas but didn't participate in  the new work, said it's not surprising to trace the mitochondrial DNA  to six women. "It's an OK number to start with right now," but  further work may change it slightly, she said.  That finding doesn't answer the bigger questions of where those women  lived, or of how many people left Beringia to colonize the Americas,  she said Thursday.  The estimate for when the women lived is open to question because  it's not clear whether the researchers properly accounted for  differing mutation rates in mitochondrial DNA, she said. Further work  could change the estimate, "possibly dramatically, " she said.  ---  On the Net:  PLoS One: http://www.plosone. org  (This version CORRECTS explanation of mitochondrial DNA))  Copyright 2008 The Associated Press.

Shirley,
 
Thanks for your comments on your line of Edward Robbins. 1836-1876. Are you saying the DNA test kit #111211 from your Robbins male doesn't match the Daniel Robins descendants? I agree that researchers now turn to DNA as the only way to find a biological relationship to a family. It's a great tool for family researchers. As technology progresses & the DNA databases grow, hopefully the future will provide us with the answers we need.

I mentioned the book I have in case someone would  like me to send them any information out of it. I have tried for  many years to find my ancestors with no luck. I believe from census  records that Edward Robbins was born in NY and may have had a brother  James. He had a son John, and daughters Ella [Erickson], Bessie  [Ferguson] and Sue Storms.  Shirley

Sending you some old as well as some new information on the Doss and  Mikels of Montgomery County, Indiana.   Greenberry Doss, son of Stephen and Permilia Cundiff Doss; and his  brother Elisha Doss. Moved to Indiana from Hardin County, Kentucky.  Seems Greenberry Doss moved to Indiana first; foloowed by brother  Elisha Doss.  Included are early land records, marriage records, and census for  Elisha Doss of 1850. (Of course Greenberry Doss was in Linn County,  Iowa by 1849.)  Greenberry Doss marries Eliza Mikels Nov. 14, 1835. He receives land,  40 more acres, Nov. 20, 1835. I assume it is Eliza Mikels dowry. And  since a John Mikels also owns land in section 14 of Franklin  Township, could be Eliza Mikels brother or father. Although, William  Mikels could be father too?  Another Mikels researcher could not define Eliza Mikels parents.  There are a number of Elizas in the records of Montgomery County,  Indiana. Do not think it is especially a short moniker name for  Elizabeth at all.  Elisha Doss married Susanna Peterson March 6, 1839. Notice in the  1850 census for Sugar Creek Township, Montgomery County,  Indiana....that Petersons are surrounding the Elisha Doss family. I  assume Susannah Peterson's father is the Solomon Peterson.   I included the bio of Joe Ward Mikels because it was so interesting  as a Mexican War veteran; and states his birth place was near  Darlington, Indiana.   Lucetta Doss (1838-1887) and here brother Thomas Doss, children of  Greenberry and Eliza Mikels Doss by Iowa records; also both born near  Darlington, Indiana.   Several other men in Montgomery County, Indiana has the first name of  Greenberry, and even just Berry.   Have never found burial or death of Eliza Mikels Doss. But Greenberry  Doss re-marries in Linn County, Iowa in 1849; to an Elizabeth Cook.  Maybe she died on the way to Iowa?  Lucetta Doss marries James Robbins...dau. Mary Ellen Robbins marries  Henry Miller; Ruby Miller marries Art Russell; parents of Daren  Russell, my father.  Steven Russell Iowa

From a conversation with another researcher I was reminded of the typo  on page 48 of the Robins, Robbins book & want to post the correction.  The line states "Hope was baptized 19 Oct 1641 and not 3 Oct 1641 "ye  19, 10 mo." The original record shows Hope was baptized "ye 19th 10 mth  41." (1641) This would be January 19th 1641 by the Old Style Calender  that was used in 1641. The correct month is January not October for her  baptism. The 10th month extended from Dec 25th to January 24th. October  is the 10th month (1st to 31st) by the New Style Calendar (Gregorian)  that we use today. John Taylor, Marshall & I have been compiling typos  & errors as we find them in the book. We will post these corrections  in the future. We strive to be as error free as possible but as the old  adage goes "to err is human." Sara

This is a conversation Gary began with me privately on the book by  Donald Lines Jacobus, "Ancient Families of New Haven." We should have  posted here in the beginning to keep the group informed but the topic  somehow drifted off our origin subject on to calendars. We'd like you  give us your thoughts/research regarding when the 1st month of the  Old Style Calendar (Julian) began. Did it begin with March 1st or  March 25th or another date?  Sara:  I notice in looking through the book "Ancient Families of New Haven"  by Donald Lines Jacobus that information looks confusing at 1st  glance, because he tried to indicate his sources for dates and events  within the annotations. Some of the abbreviations are easily guessed  at, but others are somewhat cryptic. In the Introduction of volume 1  there is an explanation of the abbreviations he used to indicate  source records for the data he has presented. For example from the  bit of information on Daniel Robinson  "ROBINSON. MISCELLANEOUS. DANIEL, of NH, rem to Crosswicks, N. J.;  m 3 Feb 1663 NHV - Hope da. William & Frances Potter, bp 3 Oct 1641  NHC1...Children recorded NHV: 1 Mary, b 14 Dec1664; 2 Daniel, b 27  Nov 1666."  We can interput to read:  ROBINSON. MISCELLANEOUS. DANIEL, of (NH=New Haven), (rem=removed)  to Crosswicks, N. J.; (m=married) 3 Feb 1663 (NHV=New Haven Vital  Statistics) - Hope (da.=daughter of) William & Frances Potter,  (bp=baptized) 3 Oct 1641 (NHC1=First Congregational Society, New  Haven)...Children recorded (NHV=New Haven Vital Statistics): 1 Mary,  (b=born) 14 Dec1664; 2 Daniel, (b=Born) 27 Nov 1666."  It is interesting that he was aware that Daniel eventually moved to  Crosswicks, even though that move didn't occur until near 30 years  after Daniel settled in Woodbridge. Also interesting is the fact  that his comment on Daniels move to Crosswicks, indicates, (to me)  that he knew Daniels name changed to Robins, though he makes no  mention of the fact in his annotation. I noticed that he comments  that many family names did not seem to settle into a final form until  near the 1800's and I think he preferred to keep the names in their  original format.  While this is all the information that he has on under Daniel  Robinson, he has abut 18 pages of descendents of the Potter Family.  By the way this book is the Ancestry.com databases, but I not sure  that links to it are always available during normal search sessions.  I have found that by going to the book itself you can use vol 9 which  is an index, to figure where to look for information you are  interested in. Here is the link to that page.  http://search. ancestry. com/cgi-bin/ sse.dll? rank=0&f2=&gskw= ancient+new+ haven&f21= &f30=&f11= &rg_f10__ date=&rs_ f10_ _date=0&f26= &ctx=%2FMercury% 2FPages% 2FCardCatListBoolea n.aspx&ccType= search&db= dbatitles& ti=0&ti.si= 0&gl=& gss=rfs&gst= &so=3&_F0003A49= 1  I've attached a pdf file containing the pages concerning the  abbreviations that Jacobus used.  Gary  Gary,  The original document for Hope Potter's baptismal date reads 19th day  10th mo 1641. We can see Jacobus records 3 Oct. 1641. His day & month  is incorrect. He figured the month on the New Style Calendar  (Gregorian) & the Old Style Calendar (Julian) was in use in 1641. The  10th month was January per OSC. Why he has 3 as the day I don't know  but the original reads 19th. Page 48 of the Robins, Robbins of NJ is  in error too & was confused with the error by Jacobus on Daniel &  Hope's marriage date. The original marriage document records Feb 10th  1663 not Feb 3rd 1663 as written by Jacobus & Daniel's surname is  spelled Robison on this document. It's difficult to read but I had it  examined by a researcher who is skilled in old handwriting & used a  special magnifying tool to enhance the document. As to Jacobus  knowing that Daniel Robinson migrated from Ct to Woodbridge & then  Crosswicks 30 yrs later isn't unusual but is a interesting point  since he doesn't reference his source. Some ideas for it could be  from the information he compiled on the Wm Potter family. He was  aware of name variations & possibly he cross referenced them. The NJ  Archives Series were available to him. Daniel & Hope as land owners  in New Haven is another link mentioned in Daniel's will. My research  of early New Haven land records indicated Daniel was never a property  owner there other than the land he refers to in his will that appears  to have been part of Hope's inheritance & not his own. In order to be  thorough I had all the name variations of Robinson, Robins, Robbinson  etc. checked in the land transactions. Jacobus' work Ancient Familes  of NH first appeared in the New Haven Genealogical Magazine in 1922 &  ran until 1932. Charles R Hutchinson's work was compiled before these  dates. I haven't found anything to indicate there was an exchange of  information between these two men but it is possible Jacobus had  access to Hutchinson's work. Your mention of Jacobus, dates etc. brings to mind the error in the  Robins, Robbins book. I need to post the correction. Thanks. Sara Sara:  Thank you for pointing out some of the errors in work of Jacobus. I  understand what you are saying about the old style and new style  calendars, but Hope was not baptized on the 19th of Oct as stated on  page 48. Nor was the 10th month Jan as stated in your previous e- mail.  In 1641, March was considered the 1st month. If March was the 1st  month then December was the 10th month. Hopes baptism recorded as 10  month 19th day of 1641, if written out in long hand should have been  December 19, 1641.  Another interesting fact is the annotation of a date like 11th month,  15th day, 1641/2 which would have been written to mean January 15,  1641 (OS)/1642 (NS) was actually incorrect because Jan 15, 1641 (OS  or Julian Calendar) was actually Jan 25, (NS or Gregorian Calendar)  Because of the confusion encountered when trying to convert the dates  to our method of annotation, the best suggestion I've read is to  annotate it the way you found it documented. Current genealogy  software doesn't allow us to do that however. Try entering  10/19/1652 in you[r] database. It will be changed to 19 OCT 1652 by the  software, so perhaps the best we can do is put the date as found in  the notes for the individual.  BTW the main reason for my earlier e-mail was to inform that Ancient  Families of New Haven was available at ancestry.com and to provide a  reference for others who may be trying to make sense out of the  Jacobus annotations.  Gary  Gary,  Thanks for your information on the NSC & OSC. From my perspective  this is how the 10th month was figured. Since the first day of the  New Year for the OSC began on March 25th at the time of Hope's  baptism this event would have occurred in the 10th month 19th day.  The 11th month would have been from Jan 25th to Feb 24th, 12th Feb  25th to March 24th. Do agree or do you figure this some other way?  Maybe I'm in error, please clarify for me if I am. I do see now there  is an error on page 48 with the month of Oct given. John, Marshall &  I have been working on compiling a list of typos & errors in order to  post corrections. If you want to post for everyone that Ancient  Families of NH is available as a reference at ancestry.com, please  do.

However, even with the  calendar change, dates will undoubtedly appear a little complicated  for researchers.   Quakers almost exclusively used numbers for months. In some cases,  researchers will find the number and name of the month, such as "4th  month called June" or "the 10th day of the 10th month called December  1690." Any date in March was considered the first month. And Sunday  was the first day of the week, Monday the second day, and so forth.  Quakers also wrote numbers in their meeting records, such as "3rd  month" instead of May (an example before 1752). Saying July (Julius),  after Julius Caesar, or August, after the Roman Emperor Caesar  Augustus, was considered too pagan or worldly.   An example of an early Quaker date might be: 2/10/1720 (with 2 being  the second month). This date should be interpreted as 10 April 1720.  For examples of Quaker dating practices, see the article by Gordon L.  Remington, "Quaker Preparation for the 1752 Calendar Change,"  National Genealogical Society Quarterly 87 (June 1999): 146-150.   http://www.ancestry .com/learn/ library/article. aspx?article= 3358  Gary  Gary,  You have made a good case for the 10th month as Dec. but I'm really  confused.

Have you, (or Sara do you know another descendent of Aaron) that has done DNA testing through family tree?  I know that several people have tested in the Sorenson DNA project and while the tested markers do match us - Sorenson doesn't test all the markers that Family tree does.

It is probable that whether or not to have DNA tested depends on numerous factors.  A person with a solid paper trail back to a common ancestor, (Daniel and Hope for example), may not feel that there is much to gain from such a test, especially when you factor in various levels of expense.  Familytree DNA has an ever increasing number of Robbins/Robins that have tested and has representatives from at least 4 apparently unrelated lines of Robins descent.  When you test with this group you know which DNA sample is yours, that in most cases names and e-mail addresses of people that match with your DNA.  This is perhaps of more value to a person that has hit a brick wall and wants to develop further clues and or at least get pointed to contacts with the same DNA.  Perhaps they have useful information to share.
 
If however you paper trail is solid, you don't have as much to gain from such testing.  It will perhaps affirm the validity of your paper trail, but beyond that the tests would be more of a benefit to the already tested group then it would be to you.  In such a case you might choose to undergo DNA testing through a project such as the Sorenson DNA Project.  Such a decision has it's pros and cons.  On the plus side, the test doesn't cost anything.  You can test individually at home, or as a group of family members at a family reunion perhaps, or even as a community such as the local LDS church, (and others) for example.  The disadvantage is that the markers they test don't all correspond to the Familytree test set, though a large number do; and they don't tell you which test is yours.  To my knowledge, the only way for you determine which set is yours is to put an easter egg in the generic gedcom file you supply with your test kit.  A little piece of unique data that you can put in the file concerning one of your ancestors.  A date for an event or a birthplace, or place of marriage for example.
 
Bear in mind that while Sorenson links the tree you provide to the DNA data set, they will not list data on any living person, so it is likely that the first name you will be able to see would be a grandparent, or possibly a great grandparent.

Gary,  Thanks for presenting your research on the OSC & NSC. It has been  helpful in determining the correct month for Hope Potter's baptism.  After review of all the research, I agree with you that March was the  first month in the OSC although the New Year in the OSC began on March  25th. This makes December the 10th month in the OSC therefore Hope was  baptized on "ye 19th 10th mo 41" or the 19th day of December 1641 as  you indicated. A very good source among others for this somewhat  compilcated subject is "The 1752 Calendar Change in North America" by  William Dollarhide. Mr. Dollarhide states the Latin names used for some  of the months relate to their position in the OSC. For example October  is based on the Latin number Octo or eight. Later October became the  10th month in the NSC but retained the name. The method of dates used  by Quakers you mentioned is additional topic of interest. I will place  the Dollarhide article in the Files & the group already has the  calendar subject links you posted.   Sara

I don't know if any of the descendants of Aaron Robins have tested through FTDNA. John German or Tamara Stevens may have the answer. The pedigrees on the Sorenson site for the Daniel Robins (Aaron) descendants contain some errors. I only found one that was correct. Looks like this site uses the Ancestral File for their genealogies.

I think you're right, in that at least some of the DNA submitters appear to use the ancestral file.  I think Sorenson also accepts hand written family trees - though I may be mistaken.  I think you are also correct if you are inferring that there are numerous errors in the ancestral files.I think that the problem stems from the fact that people are allowed to put information into the database without supporting documentation, much like many of the family trees on Ancestry.com.  To be fair the tree on my own web site lacks any supporting documentation for many of the people in it.  It doesn't mean that it is all wrong, but there are undoubtedly errors in it.  I'm attempting to put together a gedcom with the criteria of having some sort of supporting documentation, such as census, will, land deed, family bible record, etc.  I'm saddened that before the days of copy machines, my grandmother loaned an old family bible to another researcher and never got it back.
