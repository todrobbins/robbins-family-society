	<h3>My Most Memorable Christmas</h3>
	<p class="byline">by Bettylou H. Steadman</p>

	<p> I will never forget one special Christmas in 1942.  I was nine years old and living in a Children’s Home in New Jersey.  My parents had split up when I was quite young, and when I was five years old, the family doctor suggested that my mother put me in the Home for various reasons, one being that I should be with children my own age.</p>
 
	<p>I would often walk through town on my way home from school and look longingly into the store windows at toys I knew I would never have.  Around Christmas time that year, all the stores were decorated for the holidays, and I remember a Santa Claus in one store who would give us candy canes after we sat in his lap and told him what we wanted for Christmas.  There was also a microphone beside him that was connected to a loudspeaker that could be heard outside by people passing by on the street.  We were encouraged to sing Christmas carols over the mike and we loved that.</p>
 
    <p>Then one night just before Christmas, there was a knock on the door of the Children’s Home.  When my housemother answered it, there stood my father.  He had received a Christmas bonus of $50 from work and wanted to take me shopping for Christmas, so the housemother took us downtown in the Home’s car to do some last minute Christmas shopping.</p>

    <p>When we reached the toy store, my father told me I could have anything I wanted.  It was any child’s dream come true and I was in Seventh Heaven!  After picking out quite a few toys, the housemother suggested I should be more practical and get some clothes as well as toys.  So we went to a clothing store and got some clothes, too.  Fifty dollars went a long ways in those days.</p>

    <p>That was one Christmas that really stands out in my memory, and for many years after that, my dad and I would relive that night in our memories together.  It never failed to bring a warm glow and a smile to our faces.</p>
